            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60687:5"/>ſafely arrive at the port and barbour of Celeſtiall happineſſe, For if the firſt ſtep to heaven be to believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and the foundation and ground of all ſalvation be faith, as I think no man can doubt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that there is any God or truth at all, then cannot this golden Treatiſe but be acceptable to all ſuch as love Jeſus Chriſt, and tender the ſalvation of their ſouls, being as it were the heavenly pillar of fire that may guide us through the deſert of this world, unto the land of promiſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. and that glittering ſtar to lead us unto the new born King of the Jews and Saviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. But to the end that thou mayſt more plainly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly view the excellency and great neceſſity of this rare book, and as it were with <hi>Moſes,</hi> from the top of Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> contemplate the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> flowing with
<pb facs="tcp:60687:6"/>Milk and Honey, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. I will briefly ſet down ſuch motives as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to the labour of tranſlating it; for the ſelf ſame, as I verily think, cannot but in flame thee to the diligent reading of it alſo. Three principall reaſons then eſpecially moved me. The firſt was, becauſe it is very ancient, being written above eleven hundred years paſt, for it was compoſed three years after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the concluſion of the book. And as the Authour himſelf is of great antiquity, ſo is his doctrine more antient, being the ſelf ſame which flouriſhed in his time, and came from the Apoſtles of Chriſt: which thing as it was never of any good man doubted of, ſo it is alſo moſt apparent: Firſt, by ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, grounded in Gods word; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when any man writeth ought concerning faith and religion, and
<pb facs="tcp:60687:6"/>the ſame is not controld of any of that time, it is an evident argument, that it was conſonant to the doctrine then generally taught and received; otherwiſe thoſe Preſtours and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours which God (as S. Paul ſaith) <hi>hath given, that we he not little ones, wavering and carried about with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very blaſt of doctrine, Epheſ.</hi> 4. could never have held their peace, but would, as the Prophet admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, <hi>Have cried out, exalted their voice like a trumpet, Eſa.</hi> 58. as we find in like caſe, the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Nicholai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

PAVL. for an errour about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the authour himſelf doth not only confeſſe the ſame, in ſerting down the anſwer of many excellent, holy, and learned men, which lived in his daies; not only becauſe he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
<pb facs="tcp:60687:7"/>that what he hath here written, he received it from his anceſtours, and forefathers, both which he doth is the very firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and generally throughout the whole book: but eſpecially for that towards the later end he ſo highly commendeth the generall Councell of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that is, the Parliament of the world: which ſurely he never wold have done, had he not joyned with them in opinion, concerning faith and religion; and what their opinion was himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth, for he ſaith that thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, inſpired by God, decreed that nothing was to be beleeved, but that which the ſacred antiquity of out forefathers agreeing together is Chriſt, had holden and believed. Which ſurely is a notable argument, that what faith was by Chriſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his Diſciples preached, was by them carefully kept and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb facs="tcp:60687:7"/>which thing is eſpecially of us Engliſh-men to be noted, becauſe the firſt four Generall Councells, amongſt which this of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is one, and the third in order, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily allowed by act of Parliament. <hi>Anno</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Wherefore moved with ſuch reaſons, we may without all ſcruple or doubt, not onely read this book, but alſo embrace and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it, as the common doctrine of that time, as the religion practiſed and reverenced in the primitive Church as the faith and belief of the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Councell &amp; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the true doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. Now then ſeeing we live in thoſe daies in which ſo many new ſects and doctrines, ſuch ſtrange and monſtrous opinions, ſuch ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and new-fangled deviſes flie up &amp; down the world, &amp; ſeeing we are fallen into the later times in which <hi>Men ſhall heap up to themſelves

In which <hi>they ſhall love plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more then God, have a ſhew of godlineſſe but yet denying the vertue therof:</hi> 2 Tim. 3. In which <hi>many ſcoffers ſhal come, walking according to their own deſires whodevide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſenſuall, not having the ſpirit.</hi> In which <hi>many falſe Chriſts, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Prophets ſhal ariſe &amp; ſeduct many:</hi> Very neceſſary it is being thus fore-warned of God, that before all things we take great heed not to be perverted, and ſeduced by erroneous teache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Paul ſaith. Wherin we can take no better courſe, no way more ſure, then to repair to the time of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb facs="tcp:60687:8"/>Church, when the bloud of Chriſt was yet freſh bleeding in mens hearts, when the Goſpel was inſtantly preached, firmly beleeved, ſincerely practiſed, confirmed by miracles, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the death of ſo many Martyrs; eſpecially being exhorted hereunto by the holy ſcriptures: for as by them we are admoniſhed of the dangers and troubles of the later dayes, ſo are we for a preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſent to ancient times to conduct us to Gods true religion. <hi>Stand,</hi> ſaith the Prophet leremy <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>upon the way and inquire of the ancient paths, which is a good way &amp; walk in that, and you ſhal find reſt for your ſelves.</hi> Solomon likewiſe in his Proverbs admoniſheth us in this ſort: <hi>Do not paſſe the ancient bounds which thy Fathers have ſet down: Chap.</hi> 22. And in Eccleſiaſticus. <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. <hi>Do not ſet light by the report of thy elders for they have learned of

                  <p>The ſecond reaſon which ſet me forward was, for that I find this book not written againſt ſome one or a few particular falſe teachers (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and divers ancient learned Doctours did againſt the <hi>Arians, Pelagians,</hi> and ſuch like) but againſt all hereſie, or erroneous doctrine whatſoever; which is a thing of ſo great importance, as I know not what can be deviſed more. What gold were too much, or what treaſures too dear for that medicine which had virtue to cure all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Falſe doctrine and hereſie is a great ſore, a canker more peſtilent then any corporall infirmity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſeeing this worketh onely the temporall deſtruction of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that cauſeth death both of body and ſoul everlaſting. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther books we find the confutation of ſome ſpeciall point of falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; in many the overthrow
<pb facs="tcp:60687:10"/>of divers; but to deſtroy all at one blow, and thoſe each ſo contrary to themſelves, ſo diſtinct for time, ſo divers for place, ſo many for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is a property peculiar onely to this moſt excellent treatiſe: and therefore it may fitly be compared to that miraculous pond, whereof we read in the Goſpell, <hi>John.</hi> 5. which cured all diſeaſes: for as that water, moved by the Angell, cured whatſoever infirmity of him that firſt entred in: ſo this book written, no doubt, by the motion of the holy Ghoſt, hath force to cure any ſuch as is corrupted with erroneous doctrine, or to preſerve him from all infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he vouchſafe to enter in, that is to read it, to conſider, and weigh diligently what is ſaid, and diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. The reaſon why this book hath this rare quality, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, becauſe it ſheweth the right way of expounding. Gods divine
<pb facs="tcp:60687:10"/>Scripture in which ſo many to the great danger of mens ſouls, do ſo greatly go a ſtray: and therefore as <hi>David</hi> overthrowing <hi>Golias</hi> the chief Champion of the camp, put all the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> to flight, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. ſo no marvell, though this ancient Authour diſcovering the falſe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and gloſſes of ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the principall pillar of all poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned doctrine, overthroweth alſo all wicked hereſie.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt motive which incouraged me to this labour, and ought partly to move thee to the reading is the brevity of the work, the fineneſſe of the method, the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the ſtile: and therefore if long and large volumes do little pleaſe, this is ſhort which cannot cauſe diſlike; if confuſion be ingrate full, a methodicall order can not but like thee; if a ſtile harſh and courſe fitteth not thy taſte, then I truſt that
<pb facs="tcp:60687:11"/>which is fine, pleaſant and delicate, will content thy humour. Onely I am to crave pardon, that my rough and rude Engliſh, nothing anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſmooth and curious Latin. And therefore I could wiſh thee, if skill ſerveth rather to conſult with the authour himſelf, then to uſe the help of his rude interpreter; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for ſuch as be not of ſo deep reading, for whom eſpecially I have taken this pain, I am to deſire that they nothing diſlike the ſovereign medicine for the wooden box, nor the exquiſite and rare gemme for the courſe casket.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be the reaſons (Gentle Reader) which eſpecially moved me to the tranſlating of this antient and learned Father: I beſeech thee as thou tendereſt the ſalvation of thy ſoul, that thou wouldeſt vouchſafe to reade him attentively, in whom thou ſhalt ſee clearly as in a glaſſe
<pb facs="tcp:60687:11"/>the faith of our fore-fathers, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the primitive Church, and in whom thou ſhalt find by Gods word and authority of ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the madneſſe of all Hereticks cruſhed in pieces, and that in a ſhort, methodicall, and eloquent Treatiſe. The Holy Ghoſt which moved, no doubt, this antient learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father to the writing of this Work, incline and move thy heart to the diligent reading, and ſincere following of the ſame. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

To this queſtion I had uſually this anſwer of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60687:17"/>them all, that whether I or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſired to find out the fraud of Hereticks, daily ſpringing up, and to eſcape their ſnares, and willingly would continue ſafe and ſound in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that he ought two manner of wayes by Gods aſſiſtance to defend and preſerve his faith, that is firſt by the authority of the law of God: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by the tradition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
                     <p>Here ſome man perhaps may ask, that ſeing the Canon of the ſcripture is perfect and moſt aboundantly of it ſelf ſufficient for all things, what need we joyne unto it the authority of the Church her underſtanding and interpretation? The reaſon is this, becauſe the ſcripture being of it ſelf ſo deep and profound, all men do not underſtand it in one and the ſame ſenſe, but diverſe men diverſly this man and that man, this way and that way expound and interpret the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60687:17"/>ſayings thereof, ſo that to ones thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſo many men, ſo many opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons almoſt may be gathered out of them, for <hi>Novatus</hi> expoundeth it one way, <hi>Photinus</hi> another, <hi>Sabellius</hi> after this ſort, <hi>Donatus</hi> after that: <hi>Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius</hi> will have this expoſition: <hi>Appolinarius</hi> and <hi>Priſcillian</hi> will have that: <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian, Pelagius, Coleſtius,</hi> gather this ſence: and to conclude <hi>Neſtorius</hi> findeth out that: and therfore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is for the avoiding of ſo great windings and turnings of divers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that the line of expounding the Prophets and Apoſties, be directed and drawn, according to the rule of the eccleſiaſticall and Catholick ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Again in the Catholick Church, we are greatly to conſider, that we hold that, which hath been beleeved <hi>every where, alwayes, and of all men:</hi> for that is truly and properly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60687:18"/>(as the very force and nature of the word doth declare, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all things that be truely univerſall) and that ſhall we do if we follow vniuerſalitie, antiquitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.

                     <p>WHat then ſhall a Chriſtian Catholick do, if ſome ſmall part of the Church cut it ſelf off from the communion of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Faith?

What if ſome new infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction goeth about to corrupt not onely a little part, but the whole Church? Then likewiſe ſhall he regard, and be ſure to cleave unto antiquity, which cannot poſſibly be ſeduced by any crafty noveltie. What if in Antiquity it ſelf, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Antient Fathers, be found ſome errour of two or three men; or haply of ſome one City or Province? Then ſhall he diligently take heed that he preferre the decrees and determinations of the Univerſall Antient Church,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60687:19"/>before the temerity or folly of a few. What if ſome ſuch caſe happen where no ſuch thing can be found? Then ſhall he labour, by conferring and laying together amongſt them ſelves the antient Fathers opinions, not of all, but of thoſe onely which living at diverſe times, and ſundry places, yet remaining in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and faith of one Catholick Church, were approved maſters and guides to be followed: and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he perceiveth, not one or two, but all joyntly with one conſent, plainly, uſually, conſtantly, to have holden, written, and taught, let him know that without all ſcruple or doubt he ought to beleeve, hold, and profeſſe that faith, that doctrine, that religion. But for more perſpicuity and light of that which hath been ſaid: each part is to be made clear with ſeverall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and ſomewhat more at large to be amplified, leaſt too much

                     <p>When in the time of <hi>Donatus,</hi> of whom came the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> a great part of <hi>Africk</hi> fell headlong into his furious errour, and unmindfull of her name, religion, and profeſſion, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſacrilegious terrietity of one man, before the Church of Chriſt; then all thoſe of <hi>Afriek</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that profane Schiſme and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to the univerſall Churches of the world, they onely amongſt them all remaining with in the boſome of the Catholick Church could be ſaved, leaving cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a notable example to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie how ever after by good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome the ſound doctrine of all men, ought to be preferred before the madneſſe of one or a few. Likewiſe when the hereſie of the <hi>Arians</hi> had neer corrupted not a little part, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60687:20"/>well nigh the whole world, in ſuch ſort that (almoſt all the Biſhops of the latine Church deceived, partly by force, partly by fraud) mens minds were covered as it were with a miſt, what eſpecially in ſo great a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be followed: then whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a lover and a follower of Chriſt, and preferred ancient faith before new errour, was not touched with any ſpot of that infection. The danger of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> time doth abundantly ſhew, what calamity entreth in, when a new doctrine is admitted. For at that time not onely ſmall matters, but things of great importance were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown: for not onely alliance, kindred, friends, families, but alſo cities, commonwealths, countries, Provinces, yea &amp; at length the whol Romane Empire, was ſnaken and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned. For when the profane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the <hi>Arians,</hi> like ſome Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na or ſury, had firſt taken captive the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60687:20"/>Emperour, afterward ſubduing all pallaces to her new laws never ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after that to trouble and confound all things private and publicke, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not holy, putting no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt good and truth but as it were from an high place did ſtrike all at her pleaſure. Then married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were defiled, widows ſpoiled, virgins violated, Abbeys ſuppreſſed, Clergie-men vexed, Deacons bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Prieſts baniſhed, Dungeons, Priſons, Mines, filled with holy men, of which the greater part ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Citie, like exiles, pined and conſumed away amongſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, dens, and wilde beaſts, with nakedneſſe, thirſt and hunger. And all this miſery had it any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? but becauſe humane ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition was admitted for heavenly doctrine, well grounded antiquity ſubverted by wicked novelty, whileſt our Superiours decrees were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60687:21"/>our Fathers ordinances bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Canons of our aunceſtours abrogated, and whileſt the licentious libertie of prophane and new curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitie, kept not it ſelf within the chaſte limites of ſacred and ſound antiquitie.

                     <p>NEither is this any new thing, but alwaies uſual in the Church of God, that the more religious a man hath been the more ready hath he alwayes reſiſted novell inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, examples whereof many might be brought, but for brevity ſake I will onely make choice of ſome one which ſhall be taken from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick

Therefore in times paſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippinus</hi> of venerable memory Biſhop of <hi>Cart hage,</hi> the firſt of all mortall men maintained this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the divine Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rule of the univerſall Church, againſt the mind of all the Prieſts of his time, againſt the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and tradition of his forefathers, that rebaptization was to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and put in practiſe. Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of his procured ſo great dammage and hurt to the Church, that not onely it gave all hereticks a pattern of ſacrilege, but alſo mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred occaſion of errour to ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks. When therefore every where all men exclaimed againſt the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60687:24"/>novelty of the doctrine, and all prieſts in all places, each one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his zeale did oppoſe, then Pope <hi>Steven</hi> of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, biſhop of the Apoſtolique ſea, reſiſted in deed with the reſt of his fellow biſhops, but yet more then the reſt, thinking it as I ſuppoſe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo much to excell all other in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion towards the faith, as he was ſuperiour to them in authoritie of place. To conclude in his Epiſtle which then was ſent to Africk, he decreed the ſame in theſe words. <hi>That nothing was to be innovated, but that which came by tradition ought to be obſerved.</hi> For that holy and prudent man knew well, that the nature of pietie could admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but only to deliver and teach our children that religion and that faith which we received and learned of our forefathers, and that we ought to follow religion whither

For who would have eaſily imagined him to have erred, whom every man knew to have been choſen with ſuch judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Empire, who was ſo highly in grace with the Clergy, ſo much beloved of all holy men, ſo greatly in favour with the people, who openly expounded the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and alſo confuted the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous errour of the Jews: why could not this man, by ſuch means eaſily perſwade any, that he taught aright, preached aright, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved aright, who to ſmooth the way, and make entrance for his own
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60687:33"/>hereſie, perſecuted and preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the blaſphemies of all others. But this was that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith: <hi>The Lord your God doth tempt you, if you love him or no.</hi> And to paſſe over <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in whom was alwayes more admiration then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, more fame then experience whom for ſome time humane favour had made greater, then Gods grace exalted. Let us rather ſpeak of them which endowed with many gifts and men of great induſtrie, have been no ſmall tentation to Catholicks, as amongſt the <hi>Pannonians,</hi> in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers memory <hi>Photinus</hi> is recorded to have tempted the Church of <hi>Sirminum,</hi> in which being preferred with the liking of all men unto the dignity of Prieſthood, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he behaved himſelf very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickly but ſuddenly like that naughty Prophet or Dreamer of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh, he began to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60687:34"/>perſwade the people of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, to follow other gods, that is ſtrange and unknown errours, which before they were not acquainted with. But as this is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſo that was very pernicious, that he had ſo great helps and furtherance for the advancing of ſo great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe: For he was both of an excellent wit, and ſingularly well learned, and paſſing eloquent, as he which both in diſputation and writing was copious and grave, in either language, as appeareth by the Books which he wrote, partly in Greek, and partly in the Latine tongue. But it hapned well that Chriſts ſheep committed to his charge very vigilant and carefull in keeping the Catholick faith, did ſpeedily remember <hi>Moſes</hi> warning, and therefore albeit they admired much the eloquence of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Paſtour: yet were they not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60687:34"/>ignorant of the temptation. And therefore whom before they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as the chief leader of the flock, the ſame very man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they avoided as a ravening wolf. Neither do we learne only by <hi>Photinus</hi> but alſo by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Apollinaris</hi> the danger of this eccleſiaſticall tentation, and therby alſo be admoniſhed dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to keep and retaine our faith and religion. For this <hi>Apollinaris</hi> procured his auditours great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; anguiſh of mind, whileſt the authoritie of the Church drew them one way and the acquaintance of their maſter haled them another, ſo that wavering and tottering betwixt both, they were uncertaine whether part was beſt to be followed. But haply he was ſuch a one as eaſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be contemned. Nay he was ſo famous and worthie a man, that in very many things he vvon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60687:35"/>to faſt. For who ſurpaſſed him in ſharpnes of wit? in exerciſe, in learning? how many hereſies in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great books hath he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown? how many errors againſt the faith hath he confuted? That moſt notable and great work of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie books in which with great waight of reaſon he confounded, the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke cavills of <hi>Porphirius</hi> doth give credit to my report, and teſtifie the truth of my relation. It were too long to rehearſe up all his works for which he might have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the cheefe pillours of Gods Church, had not the prophane licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe of hereticall curioſitie, by inventing I know not what new opinion ſpotted and diſcredited all his former labours, whereby his doctrine was accounted not ſo much an edification, as an eccleſiaſticall tentation.</p>

But becauſe it will be profitable, I will by a little digreſſion briefely ſet down what the forenamed hereticks
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60687:36"/>
                        <hi>Photinus, Apollinaris,</hi> and <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> taught. This then is the hereſie of <hi>Photinus,</hi> he affirmeth that God is as the Jewes beleeve ſingular and ſolitary, denying the fulneſſe of the Trinitie, not beleving that there is any perſon of the word of God, or of the holy ghoſt; he affirmeth alſo, that Chriſt was only man, who had his begining of the virgin MARY, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verie earneſtly that we ought to worſhip only the perſon of God the father, and to honour Chriſt only for man. This then was <hi>Photinus</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. now <hi>Apollinaris</hi> vaunteth much as though he beleved the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Trinitie with full &amp; ſound faith but yet blaſphemeth he manifeſtly againſt our Lords incarnation. For he ſaith that our Saviour either had not mans ſoul at all, or at leaſt ſuch a one, as was neither indued with mind or reaſon; furthermore he affirmeth that Chriſts body was not taken
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60687:36"/>of the fleſh of the holy virgin MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, but deſcended from heaven into the wombe of the Virgin, holding yet doubtfully &amp; inconſtantly ſome time that it was coeternall to the word of God, ſome time that it was made of the divinitie of the word: for he would not admit two maner of ſubſtances in Chriſt, the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, the other humane, the one of his Father, the other of his Mother, but did think that the verie nature of the word was divided into two parts, as though the one remained in God, and the other was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into fleſh, that wheras the truth ſaith, that Chriſt is one conſiſting of two ſubſtances, he contrary to the truth affirmeth, of the one divinitie of Chriſt to be two ſubſtances: and theſe be the aſſertions of <hi>Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> But <hi>Neſtorius</hi> ſicke of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diſeaſe whileſt he faineth a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of two ſubſtances in Chriſt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60687:37"/>ſuddenly bringeth in two perſons: and with monſtrous wickednes, will needs have two ſonnes of God, two Chriſts one that was God, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was man, one begotten of the Father, another begotten of his Mother. And therefore he ſaieth that the holy Virgin MARY is not to be called the mother of God, but the mother of Chriſt, becauſe, that Chriſt which was borne of her was not God but man. And if any man think that in his books he ſaith there was one Chriſt and that he preached one perſon of Chriſt, I muſt needs confeſſe that he lacketh not ground to ſay ſo, for that he did either of craftie pollicie, the rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave, that by ſome good things, he might the more eaſely perſwade that which is evill, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>By the good thing he hath wrought me death. R.</hi> 7. Wherfore either craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely as I ſaid in certaine places of his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60687:37"/>writings he vaunteth to beleeve one perſon in Chriſt, or elſe ſurely he did hold, that after our Ladies deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, two perſons became in ſuch ſort one Chriſt that yet in the time of our Ladies conception or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, and for ſome time after, there were two Chriſts, and that Chriſt was born firſt like unto another man, and only was man and not yet joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in unitie with the perſon of God the word, and that afterward the perſon of the word deſcended down aſſuming and joyning him ſelf to that man in unitie of perſon, and although he now remaine in glorie aſſumpted for ſome time yet there ſeemeth to have been no difference betwixt him and other men. Thus then <hi>Neſtorius, Apollinaris, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> like mad doggs barked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Catholick Church: <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> not confeſſing the Trinity: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinaris</hi> maintaining the nature of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60687:38"/>the Word convertible, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing two ſubſtances in Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying alſo either the whol ſoul of Chriſt, or at leaſt that it was indued with mind and reaſon, beleeving for his pleaſure what he liked of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in Trinitie: <hi>Neſtorius</hi> by defending either alwayes or for ſome time two Chriſts. But the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church beleeving aright both of God and of our Saviour, neither blaſphemeth againſt the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Trinitie, nor againſt the incarnation of Chriſt, for it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipeth one Divinitie in Trinitie &amp; reverenceth the equalitie of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in one and the ſame majeſtie, confeſſing one Chriſt, not two, and the ſelf ſame both God and man, beleeving in him one perſon, yet acknowledging two ſubſtances, but yet beleeving one perſon: two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, becauſe the word of God is not mutable that it can be turned
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60687:38"/>into fleſh: one perſon, leaſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing two ſonnes, it may ſeeme to worſhip a quaternitie and not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Trinitie.</p>

                     <p>BUt it is worth the labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this matter more plainly, more ſubſtantially, more diſtinctly. In God is one ſubſtance and three perſons; in Chriſt be two ſubſtances, but one perſon. In the Trinitie there is another, and another; but not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and another thing: In our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is not another, and another, but another &amp; another thing. How is there in the Trinitie another and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but not another and another thing? Marry becauſe there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon of the father, another of the ſonne, and another of the holy ghoſt: But yet not another &amp; another nature, but one &amp; the ſelf ſame: How
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60687:39"/>is there in our Saviour another and another thing, not another and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? becauſe there is another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the divinitie, and another ſubſtance of the humanitie, but yet the deitie and the humanitie is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and another, but one and the ſelfe ſame Chriſt, one and the ſame ſonne of God, and one and the ſelfe ſame perſon, of the ſelfe ſame Chriſt and ſonne of God. As in a man the body is one thing, and the ſoule is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, but yet the body and the ſoule are but one and the ſelfe ſame man. In <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> the ſoule is one thing, the body is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and yet the body and the ſoule are not two <hi>Peters,</hi> nor the ſoule is not one <hi>Paul,</hi> and the body another <hi>Paul,</hi> but one and the ſelfe ſame <hi>Peter,</hi> one and the ſelfe ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> ſubſiſting of a double &amp; divers nature of the body and the ſoule. So therefore in one and the ſelfe ſame
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60687:39"/>Chriſt there are two ſubſtances, but one a divine ſubſtance, the other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, the one of God the Father, the other of the Virgin his Mother, the one coeternall and equall to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the other ſubſtantiall to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet one and the ſame Chriſt in both ſubſtances. Therefore there is not one Chriſt God, another Chriſt man, not one increated, another crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not one impaſſible, another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not one equal to the Father, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother leſſe then the Father, not one of the father, another of the mother, but one and the ſelfe ſame Chriſt, God and man, the ſame increated and created, the ſame incommutable and impaſſible, the ſame changed &amp; ſuffered, the ſame equall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Father, the ſame begotten of his Father before all times, the ſame conceived of his Mother in time, perfect God and perfect man; in him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60687:40"/>as God is perfect Divinitie, in him as man is perfect humanitie: perfect humanitie I ſay, becauſe it had both ſoule and body, yet a true body, ſuch as our body is, and ſuch as his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was; and a ſoule indued with underſtanding, with mind &amp; reaſon. There is therefore in Chriſt, the Word, the Soul, the Fleſh, but yet all theſe together is one Chriſt, one ſon of God, our onely Saviour and Redeemer: One I ſay, not by any I know not what corruptible confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the divinity and humanity together, but by a certain perfect, and ſingular unity of perſon: for that conjunction did not change or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert either into other (which is the proper errour of the <hi>Arians</hi>) but did rather ſo unite both in one, that as the ſingularity of one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon remayneth alwayes in Chriſt, ſo likewiſe the properties of both natures do for ever continue; ſo that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60687:40"/>neither God ever beginneth to be a body, nor now at any time ceaſeth to be a body; which thing is alſo more apparent by ſome humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: for not onely in this world, but alſo in the next every man ſhall conſiſt of body and ſoul, &amp; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall either the body be changed into the ſoul, or the ſoul ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the body; but as every man ſhall live for ever, ſo for ever of neceſſity in each man the difference of either ſubſtance ſhall continue: So likewiſe in Chriſt each property of either ſubſtance ſhall continue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſaving alwayes and reſerving the unity of perſon. And when we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten name this word <hi>Perſon,</hi> and ſay that the Sonne of God was made man, we muſt take great heed that we ſeeme not to ſay that God, the Word, the ſecond perſon in Trinitie tooke upon him our actions onely in imitation, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60687:41"/>and rather in ſhew and ſhadow, and not as a perfect and very man practiſed humane converſation: as we ſee uſed in Theaters and Stages, where one man in a little time taketh upon him many parts, of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding himſelfe is none; for as often as we counterfeit another mans actions, we ſo exerciſe his office, that yet we be not thoſe men whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we take upon us; for neither a tragedie player (to uſe prophane examples and ſuch as the <hi>Maniches</hi> alledge) when he playeth the Prieſt or King, is therefore a prieſt or king, for ſo ſoon as the tragedie endeth, that perſon alſo which he played forthwith ceaſeth. God keep us from this horrible and wicked mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie. Let this madneſſe be proper to the <hi>Maniches,</hi> which preaching abroad their owne fantaſies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme God the ſonne of God not to have been ſubſtantively the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60687:41"/>perſon of man, but to have fained the ſame by ſuppoſed action and conuerſation. But the Catholick faith affirmeth that the word of God was ſo made man, that he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our nature &amp; the proprieties belonging to the ſame, not deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in ſhew, but truely and verily, and did ſuch things as belong to man, as his owne, and not as one that imitated other mens actions, and was verily that which in life and converſation he did ſhew himſelfe to be, as we our ſelves alſo, in that we ſpeak, underſtand and ſubſiſt, do not counterfeit our ſelves to be men, but are verily men. For neither <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (to ſpeak of them eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for example ſake) were men by imitation, but by ſubſiſtence, neither likewiſe did <hi>Paul</hi> counterfeit the Apoſtle or faine himſelfe <hi>Paul,</hi> but was in veritie an Apoſtle and was <hi>Paul</hi> by ſubſiſtence.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60687:42"/>In like maner God the Word, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming and having fleſh, in ſpeaking, doing and ſuffering, in fleſh, yet without any corruption of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vouchſafed perfectly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this, to wit not that he ſhould imitate or counterfeit, but exhibit himſelf a perfect man, not that he ſhould ſeem or be thought a very man, but ſhould in veritie ſo be and ſubſiſt. Therefore as the ſoule joyned to the fleſh; and yet not turned into the fleſh, doth not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a man, but is a man, and not a man in ſhew and appearance, but in ſubſtance: ſo God the Word without any converſion of himſelf, uniting himſelf to man, was made man, not by confuſion, not by mutation, but by ſubſiſting. Let that expoſition therefore of a fained &amp; counterfeit perſon utterly be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in which alwayes one thing is in ſhew, another in deed, inw<hi rend="sup">eh.</hi> he that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60687:42"/>doth ought, is never the ſame perſon whom he repreſenteth: for God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that we ſhould believe that God the Word took upon him the perſon of man, after ſuch a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner; but rather in this ſort, That his ſubſtance remaining incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable in it ſelf, and yet taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the nature of perfect man, was himſelf fleſh, was himſelf a man, was himſelf the perſon of a man not deceitfully but truly, not in imitation, but in truth and ſubſtance; not finally after that ſort which with action ſhould deſiſt, but after that manner which perfectly in ſubſtance ſhould perſiſt. This unity therefore of perſon in Chriſt was not framed, and finiſhed after the Virgins deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but in her very womb. For we muſt diligently take heed that we confeſſe Chriſt not onely one, but alſo to have been alwayes one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an intolerable blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60687:43"/>to grant him now to be one, and yet contend that once he was not one, but two, that is one after the time of his Baptiſme, but two in the time of his Nativitie; which great ſacriledge we cannot otherwiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, but by confeſſing that man was united to God in unity of perſon, not in his Aſcention, not in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, not in his Baptiſme, but in his mothers womb, and immaculate conception: by reaſon of which U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſon, both the Proprieties of God are indifferently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcually attributed to man, and the proprieties of man aſcribed to God: hence cometh that which is written in the Scripture, That the Son of man deſcended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Lord of Majeſty was Crucified upon earth: <hi>Joan.</hi> 6. hence alſo it proceedeth that we ſay, that when our Lords fleſh was made, when our Lords body was framed,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60687:43"/>that the very Word of God was made, the very wiſdome of God was repleniſhed with created know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as in the foreſight of God <hi>His hands and feet are ſaid to be digged, Pſalm.</hi> 21. From this unity of Perſon, I ſay it proceedeth, by reaſon of like myſtery, that when the fleſh of the Word of God was born of his pure and immaculate mother, we do moſt Catholickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God himſelf the Word was born of the Virgin, and moſt impiouſly the contrary is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which being ſo, God forbid that any one ſhould go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the holy <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> of the priviledges of Gods favour as her eſpeciall glory: For ſhe is by the ſingular grace of our Lord and God her ſon, to be confeſſed moſt truly and moſt bleſſedly to have been the mother of God, but yet not in ſuch ſort, as impious hereticks imagine
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60687:44"/>and ſuſpect, who affirm, that ſhe is to be reputed in name onely and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation the mother of God, as ſhe forſooth which brought forth that man which afterward became God, as we ſay, ſuch a woman is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Prieſt or Biſhop, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe brought him that then was either Prieſt or Biſhop, but by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating that man which afterward was made a Prieſt or Biſhop: not in that manner I ſay the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is to be called the mother of God, but rather, becauſe, as hath been ſaid, that moſt holy myſtery was finiſhed in her ſacred womb, wherein by reaſon of a ſingular, and one onely unity of perſon, as the Word in fleſh is fleſh, ſo man in God is God.</p>

Bleſſed I ſay be the Church, which, to the end ſhe may confeſſe Chriſt alwayes to be and to have been one, acknowledgeth man united to God, not after our Ladies delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but even then in his mothers womb. Bleſſed I ſay be the Church, which underſtandeth God made man, not by any converſion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by reaſon and means of

Bleſſed I ſay be the Church, which teacheth that this unity of perſon hath ſo great force, that by reaſon thereof by a myſtery ſtrange and ineffable, ſhe aſcribeth unto man the proprieties of God, and attributeth to God the proprieties of man. For by reaſon of this unity of perſon ſhe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that man as he was God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Heaven; and God as he was man, was made upon earth, ſuffered and was Crucified.

                     <p>WE have ſaid in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that in the Church of God, the errour of the maſter is a great tentation to the people; and the more learned he were that erred, ſo much the greater was the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Which we ſhewed firſt by the authority of holy Scripture, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the examples eccleſiaſticall of thoſe men, which for ſome time were reputed and accounted ſound in faith, yet at laſt fell either into ſome other mans error, or els coined a new hereſie of their own: This ſurely is a great matter, profitable to be learned

But I ſuppoſe that, although I could bring forth many to ſhew this kind of tentation, yet there is almoſt none which can be compared to the tentation of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> in whom were very many gifts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o rare, ſo ſingular, ſo ſtrange, that in the beginning any would have thought that his opinions might have been believed of all men. For if life procureth authority, he was a man of great induſtry of great chaſtity, patience, and labour: if family or learning, who more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? being of that houſe which was honourable for Martyrdome, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterward for Chriſt deprived
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60687:47"/>not of father onely, but alſo ſpoiled of all his patrimony, and ſo much he profited in the myſteries of holy poverty, that as it is reported, for the confeſſion of Chriſts name he often indured much affliction. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he only adorned with theſe gifts, all which afterward ſerved for tentation, but was indued alſo with a force of wit ſo profound, ſo quick, ſo elegant, that he far excelled almoſt all other whatſoever. A man of ſuch wonderfull learning and eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that there were few things in Divinity, in humane Philoſophy, haply nothing which he had not perfectly attained: who having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the treaſures of the Greek tongue, laboured alſo about the Hebrew. And for his eloquence what ſhould I ſpeak of it, whoſe talk was ſo pleaſant, ſo delectable, ſo ſweet, that in mine opinion, not words but hony flwed from his mouth? What
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60687:47"/>things were ſo hard to beleeve which with force of argument he made not plaine, what ſo difficult to bring to paſſe, which he made not to ſeem eaſie? But perchance he maintained his aſſertions by arguments only. Nay, without queſtion there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Doctour which uſed more examples of ſacred ſcripture. But yet happelie he wrote not much. No man living more; yea ſo much that in mine opinion all his works are ſo far from being read over, that they can not poſſiblie all be found; who not to lack anie furtherance to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lived alſo untill he was paſſing old. But yet perchance unfortunate in his ſcholers. What man ever more happie, having trained up and been maſter to infinite Doctours, to Prieſts without number, to Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours and Martyrs? Now who is able to proſecute with words, in what admiration he was with all men? in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60687:48"/>what glory? in what credit &amp; grace? Who more zealous in religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired not to him, from the furtheſt parts of the world? What Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian did not almoſt worſhip him as a Prophet? What Philoſopher did not honour him as a maſter? &amp; how greatly he was reverenced, not only of private men, but alſo of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire it ſelf, hiſtories doe ſpeak, which report that he was ſent for of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Emperours mother, to wit, for the merit of his heavenly wiſdome with the grace and love whereof he was inflamed. His epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les alſo teſtifie the ſame thing, which with the authoritie of a Chriſtian maſter he wrote unto <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperour, the firſt Chriſtian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Romane Princes. And if any man upon our report admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the teſtimonie of a Chriſtian touching his wonderfull knowledge, and learning, at leaſt let him receive

                        <hi>your Lord God doth tempt you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you love him or no.</hi> And ſurely it is not only a tentation, but alſo a great tentation, when a man ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſecretly and by little and little the Church depending upon him (admiring his wit, knowledge, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, converſation, and grace, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuſpecting him, nothing fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him) ſuddenly from the old reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to a prophane and new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But ſome will ſay that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> books be corrupted: I will not gaine-ſay it, but rather wiſh it were ſo: for that hath both been ſaid &amp; written by ſome, not only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, but alſo Hereticks. But this is now the point we are to conſider, that although not he, yet the books paſsing abroad under his name are a great tentation, which ſtuffed with many horrible blaſphemies, are read and uſed, loved, and liked, not as the books of others, but as his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60687:50"/>works: ſo that although <hi>Origen</hi> gave no cauſe of erroneous doctrine, yet his authoritie hath been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion why the errour hath been lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and followed.</p>
                     <p>The caſe alſo of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is the very ſame with the former: for as <hi>Origen</hi> is to be thought the beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Greek Doctours, ſo <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> without controverſie is the chief of all the latin. For who was more learned then hee? Who in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie or Humanitie more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? for by his great and wonderfull capacitie of wit, he attained to, and underſtood all Philoſophie, all the ſects of Philoſophers, all their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours and patrons, all their learning, all ſorts of hiſtories and ſtudies. And for his wit, was he not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſo grave, ſo ſharpe, that he almoſt undertook the overthrow of nothing which either by quicknes of wit or weight of reaſon he cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60687:50"/>not in peeces? Now who is able to ſet down the commendation and praiſe which his ſtile and phraſe of ſpeech deſerved, which was ſo fraught (I know not how) with that force of reaſon, that ſuch as could not be perſwaded, were compelled: whoſe almoſt ſo many words, were ſo many ſentences ſo many ſences, ſo many victories? This is well known to <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Appelles,</hi> well known to <hi>Praxeas,</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes,</hi> the Jews underſtand this, the Gentiles have tryed it, the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> have proved it, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have felt it: whoſe blaſphemous opinions he hath overthrown with his many and great volumes, as it had been with thunder &amp; lightning. And yet this man after all this, this <hi>Tertullian</hi> I ſay, not holding the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick religion, that is the univerſal &amp; old faith being far more eloquent then faithful, changing afterward
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60687:51"/>his mind, did at laſt that which the bleſſed Confeſſour <hi>Hilarie</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place writeth of him. <hi>He diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited</hi> (quoth he) <hi>with his later errour his probable writings;</hi> and therefore he was alſo a great tentation in the Church. But hereof I will ſay no more, onely this I add, that by his defending againſt the precept of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for true propheſies the new madneſſe of <hi>Montanus</hi> ſpringing up in the Church, and thoſe mad dreams of new doctrine of that fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick woman, he deſerved that we ſhould alſo ſay of him and his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: <hi>If a Prophet ſhall riſe up in the midſt of thee,</hi> and ſtraight after, <hi>thou ſhalt not heare the words of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (quoth he) <hi>your Lord God doth tempt you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you love him or no.</hi> We ought therefore evidently to note by theſe ſo many, ſo great, and divers others ſuch weighty examples, and by the

O the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate of ſuch perſons! with what ſeas of cares, with what ſtorms are they toſſed! for ſome time as the wind driveth them, they are caried away headlong into errour, another time coming again to themſelves, they are ſhaken and beaten like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary waves ſtriving together, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with raſh preſumption they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch things as ſeem uncertain an <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

                     <p>BUt peradventure ſome will ſay, ſhall we then have no advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion in the Church of Chriſt? no growing on, no proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward? To which I anſwer and ſay. Let us a Gods name have the greateſt and moſt that may be. For who is either ſo envious to men, or hatefull to God which would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſtop or hinder that? but yet in ſuch ſort and with this proviſo, that it may appear to be truly an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in faith, and not prove to be a change in religion; for this is the nature of ſuch things as increaſe, that in themſelves they become
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60687:57"/>and grow greater; and this is the nature of a change and mutation, that ſomething be turned from one thing which it was, to an other which it was not: Convenient it is, and very neceſſary, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, knowledge and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, aſwell of every man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as of all in common; as well of one alone, as of the whole Church in Generall, of all ages and times paſt, ſhould abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe and go forward, but yet for all that, onely in his own kind and nature; that is, in the ſame faith, in the ſame ſenſe, in the ſame ſentence. In this cafe, let the religion of our ſoul imitate the nature of our bodies, which although with proceſſe of time they paſſe over many years, yet they remain the ſame that they were. There is great difference betwixt flouriſhing youth and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60687:58"/>age, yet the ſelf ſame men become old which before were young; ſo that although the ſtate and condition of one and the ſelf ſame man be altered, yet one very nature and perſon doth ſtill remain. The limbs and members of infants be ſmall, of young men great, yet not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers but the very ſame. So many joynts as young children have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have they when they be men, and if any parts there be, which with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of years ſpring forth, thoſe before by nature were in man virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally planted, ſo that no new things come forth in old men, which before were not contained in them being yet children. Wherefore there can be no doubt, but that this is the due and right order of growing, the moſt naturall and goodlyeſt way of increaſing, onely to have in old years, thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, thoſe parts and joynts which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60687:58"/>the wiſdome of our Creatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore framed when we were yet but little ones: And therefore if a man be afterward changed into ſome other ſhape or likenes then his nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; or if the number of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be more or leſſe then nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth; then of neceſſitie the whole body muſt either periſh, or become monſtrous, or at leaſt remaine lame and maimed. In like manner Chriſtian religion muſt follow theſe rules of increaſing and growing; to wit, that with years it waxe more ſound, with time it become more ample, with continuance it be more exalted, yet remaine pure and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and continue full and perfect with each of his parts, and as it were, with all his members and proper ſenſes: And furthermore that it admit no change or mutation, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine no loſſe of his proprietie, no varietie or mutabilitie in definition:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60687:59"/>for example ſake. Our forefathers in old time in the ſpiritual field of the Church, ſowed the wheaten ſeed of true faith and religion; it were now very injurious and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that we their poſteritie in ſtead of the perfect and true graine ſhould reape the falſe errour of coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle: And contrariwiſe it is reaſon and very convenient, that the beginning and ending not diſagreing with it ſelf, we ſhould of the increaſe of wheaten ſeed reape the fruit of a wheaten religion; ſo that when with tract of time, any of thoſe firſt ſeeds beginne to bud and come forth, let them be tilled, let them bee trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet without changing ought of the proprietie of the corn ſpringing up: and albeit faſhion, ſhape, and diſtinction, be added and put to, yet muſt the nature of each kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and abide. For God forbid that thoſe roſie plants of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60687:59"/>doctrine ſhould be changed into thiſtles and thornes; God forbid I ſay, that in this ſpirituall paradiſe, of the ſlippes of Cinamon and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſhould ſuddenly grow up dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel and poiſon. Therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath by the grace of God and our Fathers faith been ſowen in this Church, reaſon it is that the ſame be cultivated and maintained by the induſtry of the children, meet that it flouriſh &amp; waxe ripe, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that it grow and come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; lawfull indeed it is, that thoſe ancient articles of heavenly philoſophie, ſhould be trimmed, ſmoothed, and poliſhed: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull that they ſhould be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, mangled, and maimed. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they receive perſpicuitie, light, and diſtinction, yet of neceſſitie muſt they retaine their fulnes, ſoundnes, and proprietie. For if once this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſnes of wicked fraud be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60687:60"/>I tremble to ſpeak what danger is like to enſue of raſing and ſubverting religion; for if we take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any part of the Catholick faith, ſtraight wayes other parts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that other, and againe other, and that as it were of cuſtome and by a kind of law, ſhall be aboliſhed. And what followeth when every part by little and little is undermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that in concluſion the whole corps of religion at one blow be come ſubverted and over thrown? And contrariwiſe if new things and old, forreine and domeſticall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and ſacred, begin once to be confounded together, then muſt needs this cuſtome generally follow, that nothing hereafter remaine in the Church untouched, nothing without corruption, nothing ſound, nothing pure, nothing ſincere; and ſo where before was the ſacred ſchool of chaſt and immaculate truth, there
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60687:60"/>ſhall be a very brothel houſe of wicked &amp; filthie errours. But God of his goodnes deliver his ſervants from ſuch minds and let the impious rather, &amp; graceleſſe follow that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; mad proceeding. For the Church of Chriſt is a carefull &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent keeper of religion committed to her charge, ſhe never changeth or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth in it any thing, ſhe diminiſheth nothing, ſhe addeth nothing: What is neceſſarie ſhe loſeth not, what is ſuperfluous ſhe forceth not, her own ſhe maintaineth, what is not her own ſhee uſurpeth not, but with all indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie laboureth only about this one thing, that is, by faithfull &amp; prudent handling of our forefathers doings, what by them in times paſt was well entered &amp; begun, ſhe poliſheth; what then was well poliſhed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhe confirmeth; what then was confirmed and defined, ſhe retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. To conclude what hath ſhe elſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60687:61"/>endeavoured by the decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, but that that doctrine which before was ſimplie credited, the ſame afterward ſhould be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently beleeved: that religion which before was taught more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſame afterward ſhould be preached more inſtantly: That faith which before was more ſecurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced, the ſame afterward ſhould more carefully be practiſed. This I ſay alwayes and nothing els hath the Church, provoked with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties of Hereticks, ſet down by the decrees of her Councels, to wit, onely to confirme that to poſteritie by writing (comprehending a great ſumme of things in few words, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times for more eaſie underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to an old article of faith giving a new name) which before by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhe had received of her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>

Such were they whom the Apoſtle ſharply reprehendeth in the 2. Epiſtle to the Cor. Chap. 11: <hi>For ſuch falſe Apoſtles</hi> (quoth he) <hi>are crafty workers transfiguring them ſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</hi> What is transfiguring them ſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, but this? The Apoſtles alleaged the examples of ſcripture &amp; they likewiſe cited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The Apoſtles cited the authority of the Pſalms, &amp; they likewiſe uſed it: The Apoſtles uſed the ſayings of the Prophets, and they in like manner brought them forth. But when that ſcripture which was alike alleadged, alike cited, alike brought forth, was not alike, &amp; in one ſenſe expounded, then were diſcerned the ſimple from the craftie, the ſincere from the

And no marvel (ſaith S.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60687:67"/>we make no ſcruple or doubt, when we ſee any alledge ſome place of the Apoſtles, or Prophets, againſt the Catholick Faith, but that by his mouth the Devil himſelf doth ſpeak. For as at that time, the head ſpake unto the head, ſo now the members do talk unto the members; that is, the members of the Devil to the members of Chriſt, the faithleſſe to the faithfull, the it religious to the religious, to conclude, Hereticks to Catholicks. But what I pray, ſaith the Devil? <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God</hi> (quoth he) <hi>caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> That is to ſay. Deſireſt thou to be the Son of God, and to injoy the inheritance of the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down,</hi> that is, Caſt thy ſelf down from this doctrine and tradition of this high and lofty Church, which is reputed to be the Temple of God. And if any one demand of theſe Hereticks, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them ſuch things, how
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60687:68"/>do you prove and convince me that I ought to forſake the old and Univerſall Faith of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; ſtraight wayes is ready at hand: <hi>For it is written:</hi> and forthwith he will alledge you a thouſand Teſtimonies, a thouſand Examples, a thouſand authorities out of the Law, out of the Pſalms, out of the Apoſtles, out of the Prophets; by which, expounded after a new and wicked faſhion, he would throw headlong unfortunate ſouls, from the Tower of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, into the deep dungeon of wicked Hereſie. Now with theſe ſweet promiſes which follow, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks do wonderfully deceive ſimple men. For they dare promiſe and teach that in their Church, that is in the conventicle of their communion, is to be found a great and ſpeciall, yea and a certain perſonall grace of God: So that whoſoever be one of their crew, they ſhall ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60687:68"/>without any labour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtudy without any induſtry, yea although they never ſeek, nor crave, nor knock, have ſuch ſpeciall diſpenſation, that they ſhall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up with the hands of Angels, that is, preſerved by Angelicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; that they never hurt their foot againſt a ſtone, that is, that they never can be ſcandalized. But ſome man will ſay, If the Devil and his Diſciples, whereof ſome be falſe Apoſtles, falſe Prophets, and falſe Teachers, and all perfect He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, do uſe the Scriptures, cite their ſayings, bring forth their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; what ſhall Catholick men do? How ſhall the children of the Church behave themſelves? How ſhall they in the holy Scriptures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern truth from falſhood? To which I anſwer, that, They muſt have great care (as in the beginning of this Treatiſe I ſaid, holy and learned men taught me) that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret

Firſt by the authoritie of the divine ſcripture: ſecondly by the tradition of the Catholick Church; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Canonicall ſcripture is not

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60687:77"/>that time ſhould be ſpent with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of witneſſes: and further, no man doubted but that thoſe ten did little differ in opinion from all the reſt of their fellow Biſhops. After all this we ſet down the worthy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which is to be found in the Eccleſiaſticall acts of that Councell. For when the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of S. <hi>Capreolus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> was read, who intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, nothing elſe deſired, but that novelty might be overthrown, and antiquity defended, Biſhop <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> ſpake and gave his definition in this ſort: for I have thought good not to omit it here: theſe then be his words in the end of the acts of that Councell. <hi>And this epiſtle</hi> (quoth he) <hi>of the venerable and rel gious man Capreolus Biſhop of Carthage, ſhall be ad oyned to the faith of the Councels acts, whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is plain and perſpicuous, for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60687:77"/>he deſireth that the doctrine of the old faith may be confirmed, and new opinions ſuperſtuouſly invemed, and impiouſly ſpread abroad, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and condemned.</hi> To which all the Biſhops with one conſent cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out: This we ſpeake all, this we teach all, this we deſire all. What I beſeech you ſaid they all, what deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they all? ſurely nothing elſe But that that which was of old time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, might be ſtill retained, and that which was newlie invented, might ſpeedilie be rejected. After that wee had admired, and highly commended the great humilitie and holineſſe of that Councell, in which were ſo many Biſhops, almoſt the greater part of whom were <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> of ſuch erudition, of ſuch learning, that they were almoſt all ſufficient to have diſputed of matters of faith; Which great aſſemblie and meeting together although it might
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60687:78"/>in ſome mans opinion have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened them to preſume and determine ſomewhat of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet they delivered nothing, preſumed nothing, arrogated no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to themſelves; but above all things, they were very carefull not to leave any thing to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which before they had not received of their fore-fathers, not thinking it ſufficient to diſpoſe well of the buſineſſe then preſent, but alſo to leave an example to their poſterity, how they in like manner ſhould reverence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of ſacred Antiquity, and utterly condemn the inventions of profane Noveltie; We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed alſo againſt the wicked preſumption of <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> who boaſted, that he was the firſt and the onely man which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Scriptures, and that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60687:78"/>all others which before his daies preached and taught, all that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and expounded the word of God, were ignorant and unskilfull, that is, all Prieſts, all Confeſſours and Martyrs, of whom ſome had expounded Gods law, others allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and believed them; to conclude he maintained that the Church both now did erre, and alwayes had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe as he thought, it had and did follow unlearned and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctours. All which, albeit they were abundantly ſufficient for the overthrow and extinguiſhing of all profane novelties: Yet leaſt that ought ſhould in ſuch plenty of proofs be wanting, we added for a concluſion, a double authority of the Sea Apoſtolick, the one of holy <hi>Pope Xiſtus,</hi> which venerable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now honoureth the Church of Rome, the other of Pope <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> of bleſſed memory his predeceſſour,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60687:79"/>which I have thought good alſo here to ſet down. Pope <hi>Xiſtus</hi> then in his Epiſtle which he wrote to the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> touching the cauſe of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> ſaith thus. <hi>Therefore</hi> (quoth he) <hi>becauſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the faith is one, that which evidently hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to be ſo called, let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and ſuch things as are to be holden let us beleeve.</hi> Afterward he proſecuteth and explicateth what thoſe things be, which are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, what they be which are to be kept ſaying thus: <hi>Nothing</hi> (quoth he) <hi>is further lawfull for Novelly, becauſe it is convenient that nothing be added to Antiquity. The faith and belief of our forefathers is clear and perſpiouous, let it not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled nor defiled with any permixtion of dirt or mire.</hi> A poſtolically ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in commendation of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers faith, to compare it to light
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60687:79"/>and perſpicuity, and in likening no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell prophaneſs to the admixtion of frith and mire. <hi>Pope Coleſtinus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is of the ſame opinion, for in his Epiſtle which he ſent to the Prieſts of <hi>France,</hi> wherein he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth their diſſimulation, in that by their ſilence they left the old ſaith deſtitute, and ſuffered profane No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties to ſpring up, thus he writeth: <hi>Worthily</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the cauſe doth touch us, if with ſilonce we foſter er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60687:80"/>divers accuſe unto me your Cities and Provinces, that through your pernicious diſſimulation you cauſe them to yield unto certain new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: <hi>Therfore</hi> (quoth he) <hi>if the matter be ſo, let Novelty ceaſe to moleſt Antiquity.</hi> This then was the bleſſed opinion of holy <hi>Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> not that Antiquity ſhould ceaſe to overthrow Novelty, but rather that Novelty ſhould give over to trouble Antiquity. Which Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Catholick decrees whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſiſts, firſt of neceſſity he muſt proudly contemn the memory of S. <hi>Celeſtinus,</hi> who defined that novelty ſhould give over to provoke anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Again he muſt jeſt and ſcoff at the decree of holy <hi>Xiſtus,</hi> whoſe judgement is, that nothing is lawfull for novelty, becauſe it is not coveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that ought be added to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Again he muſt contemn the determination of bleſſed <hi>Cyrill,</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60687:80"/>who highly commended the zeal of venerable <hi>Capreolus,</hi> in that he deſired, that the old Articles of Faith ſhould be confirmed, and new inventions utterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Likewiſe he muſt reject the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that is, the judgement almoſt of all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhops of the Eaſt, who inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God, would not decree that poſterity ſhould, beleeve ought, but that which the ſacred Antiquity of our Forefathers agreeing together in Chriſt had holden and belceved, who with their uniform allowing and acclamation teſtified, that they all decreed, all wiſhed, all gave judgement, that as all Hereticks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt before <hi>Neſtorius</hi> contemning antiquity and defending Novelty were condemned: ſo likewiſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius</hi> himſelf the Authour of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty and impugner of Antiquity ſhould be condemned. Whoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60687:81"/>conſent and agreement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Gods goodneſſe if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any diſlike, what remaineth but that he maintain that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> his profane opinion was unjuſtly condemned? Finally he muſt alſo reject and contemn the univerſall Church of Chriſt, and her maſters the Apoſtles and Prophets, and eſpecially the doctrine of S. PAUL, as dregs and droſſe. The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, becauſe ſhe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes religiouſly kept and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that faith which was once delivered; S. PAUL, becauſe he hath thus written, <hi>O Timothy keep the depoſitum, avoiding profane No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties of voyces:</hi> And again, <hi>if any preach unto you otherwiſe, then you have received be he accurſed.</hi> So that if neither the Apoſtle his definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the Eccleſia ſticall Canons ought to be violated, by which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſacred conſent of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60687:81"/>and antiquity, alwayes all hereticks, and laſtly <hi>Pelagius, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtinus,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> were juſtly &amp; deſervedly condemned; ſurely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is that hereafter all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks which deſire to ſhew themſelves true children of their mother the Church, adhere, joyn, and ſtick cloſe unto the holy faith of their holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deteſting and abhorring, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing and oppoſing the profane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties of all profane miſcreants whatſoever. This almoſt is the ſumme of that which in theſe two <hi>Commonitory</hi> Books we have more amply diſcourſed of, and now after the manner of recapitulation in few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er words gathered together, that my memory, for helping whereof I have wrote this Treatiſe, may both with daily admonition be repaired, and yet not overlaid with any tedious prolixity.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60687:86"/>I ſhall lay the firſt grounds of my proofs in thoſe things which are unqueſtionable unto all, as being daily ſeen practiſed in the Church of Chriſt, and are moſt apparant to ſenſe it ſelf. I do not ſpeak of the vices of evill Chriſtians, who as ſuch are ſequeſtred rather, and cut off from the communication and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Church; but of thoſe good members of it, which not onely bear and profeſſe the name of Chriſtians, but alſo prove themſelves to be ſuch by their virtuous lives and actions. This done, I ſhall produce reaſons grounded in thoſe actions of Chriſt which are moſt generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and allowed of by all, ſo that the latter ſhall manifeſtly confirm the former; the things preſent, thoſe which are paſt. But becauſe the chief effect at which the inſtitution of the Church aims, is Juſtice, and an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible and unſpotted life: our
<pb facs="tcp:60687:86"/>Saviour ſaying (ſpeaking of the members of his Church) <hi>Ego veni ut vitam habeant &amp; abundantiùs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beant:</hi> To this end I came that they may live, and that they live more abundantly. Firſt therefore I ſhall in due order prove the truth of the Chriſtian Faith, by reaſons truly grounded in the virtuous lives of good Chriſtians. Secondly, in the cauſes of ſuch a life: and laſtly in the effects of the ſame life, wherein I ſhall compriſe all thoſe things which are daily exerciſed in the Church Militant of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is altogether neceſſary that every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that in the world there is a true Religion: By Religion we underſtand a due Worſhip exhibited unto Almighty God, as he is the univerſall fountain, ſource, and moderatour of all things: For every effect doth exhibite a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain worſhip to its cauſe whilſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting its ſelf unto it, and as it were invocating it with a kind of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60687:88"/>it ſtrives to imitate and make it ſelf like unto it, which expreſſes nothing elſe but a certain return of honour from the effect to its cauſe, that it may be more and more perfected by it. Wherefore Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God being the univerſall Cauſe of all things, of whom hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth and all that hath goodneſſe in it, have their whole being and dependance: moſt clear it is that in man there ought to be an ingrafted and naturall inſtinct to convert it ſelf to God, and to invoke and ſubject himſelf unto him, to do his uttermoſt to become like unto him, and to be perfected by him, which is nothing elſe then to exhibite worſhip unto him. Now if there be ſuch a naturall inclination in the rationall nature of man to worſhip his Creatour, and that this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be ſuperfluous, or in vain, we muſt of force conclude, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60687:88"/>there is a true Religion to be found amongſt men.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, ſeeing that man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to the divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (as every effect is to its cauſe) and that he is rationall, as not being neceſſitated to any thing, as other brute and irrationall things are, which are naturally carried away by their appetites; but having a true domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over his actions, he freely diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them as he liſt. Now if all men (as naturall reaſon is oftentimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defective) ſhould fall into ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and groſs an errour, that there ſhould be no true and divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip found amongſt them, it would follow that they would be ſo depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the divine Providence, that there would appear no Divine care exerciſed towards them in the thing which is of all others moſt neceſſary and naturall unto them; ſeeing that this true divine Worſhip is that, by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60687:89"/>which man is to arrive to the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his laſt end. But this I have elſewhere plainly refuted.</p>
                     <p>I adde that every countrey and nation, in every age both paſt and preſent, having been (though in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes) addicted unto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, it muſt neceſſarily follow that this truth is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted and naturall unto man; for that is naturall (as I have elſewhere ſhowen) which agrees unto all, and at all times, wherefore if there ſhould be no true divine Worſhip found, this natural inclination would be wholly fruſtrate, ſeeing it were not able to arrive unto the end which it was ordained for: whence it would follow that Almighty God executed his Providence more towards unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures then towards man.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, ſeeing that every cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes its perfection and goodneſſe, as much as poſſible it may, into its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60687:89"/>intending by all means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it, and make it as farre as it hath capacity like unto it ſelf; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God being ſuperlatively good, and the firſt origin of all things, hath queſtionleſſe a ſpeciall care of the perfection of man, for whoſe ſake and uſe, he made all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour creatures: wherefore, the true perfection of man princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conſiſting in the ſubjecting himſelf unto God, and in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine veneration in the which Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth chiefly conſiſt, it follows that there is a true Religion to be found in the world.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> There are two ſorts of Divine Worſhip.</head>
                     <p>MAn having a capacity to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite veneration unto Almighty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60687:90"/>God two wayes, corporally and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, we ought to diſtinguiſh two ſorts of Divine Worſhip in him, to wit, interiour and exteriour: interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is that which we perform by the acts of our underſtanding and will: exteriour is that which we exhibite by a perſonall reverence, externall ceremonies, and corporall ſacrifices. Now as all matters are naturally made and ordained for their forms, ſo queſtionleſſe the externall Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath a due ſubordination to the interiour.</p>
                     <p>This interiour Divine Worſhip is nothing elſe but a righteouſneſſe and perfection of the interiour man, by the which God is moſt honoured, which I prove in this manner. Every cauſe receives moſt honour from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of its more principall effects, whence artizans become famous by the excellence of their maſter-pieces; but there is no viſible effect more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60687:90"/>noble then man, who, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent he becomes in perfection, the more is the Divine Honour increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now he is ſo much the more perfect, by how much his life is more holy, for ſanctity is the perfection of the interiour man, by which even the whole man is perfected; and therefore the chief honour that man does Almighty God, is by a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, holy, and perfect life, and in this manner, the true and entire wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Almighty God is the life of an upright and virtuous man beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo by his actions, as they have a reference unto his Creatour.</p>
                     <p>We do not worſhip Almighty God meerly and preciſely for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but alſo that we may obtain from him that ſupreme bliſſe for which man is created; wherefore, the true Religion is the means and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for the gaining of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme felicity of man, as we ſee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60687:91"/>cauſes exact the congruous diſpoſitions of that ſubject or matter into which they produce their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſeeing therefore it is manifeſt that man is much more perfectly diſpoſed for the obtaining his chief bliſſe by a virtuous life, then by ſacrifices and exteriour Ceremonies; it is no leſſe certain that the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conſiſts in the righteouſneſſe of life.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Almighty God not being a body but a pure act, man becomes more like him by the purity of his interiour part, then by any exteriour integrity, and therefore God is more perfectly worſhipped by the ſpirit, then by any functions of the body; for Almighty God being a Spirit, it behoves thoſe that worſhip him, to adore him in ſpirit and verity.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That there is no better life then that of Chriſtians.</head>
                     <p>THere is no life more perfect and holy then the life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for if we take a view of all living creatures, we ſhall find in the loweſt degree of life thoſe which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy vegetation or growth, as plants, thence we raiſe us unto the animall or ſenſitive life, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life admits a latitude of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers degrees of ſenſitive perfection, whereof that degree is more perfect which enjoyes the perfect degree of ſenſations. Now the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life farre exceeding that which is onely vegetive and ſenſible, we eaſily conclude that the life of beaſts is farre inferiour to the life of man, in which alſo we diſtinguiſh
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60687:92"/>divers degrees of actuall perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though not of eſſentiall, for we preferre thoſe that follow the light and <hi>dictamen</hi> of reaſon, before thoſe who ſwerving from it and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſon, give the full ſcope and rains to ſenſe. The reaſon is clear; becauſe the more they neglect rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and addict themſelves to ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pleaſure, the leſſe they participate the life of man, and become more like unto beaſts; but thoſe who are guided by reaſon and do ſuppreſſe the brute and inferiour part, do lead the life of man and not of beaſts; there being therefore in man a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of theſe two degrees of the rationall and brute life, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall being farre more excellent of the two, it muſt needs follow that that man is more perfect who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf to a rationall life, then he who gives himſelf over to the life of brutes, now amongſt thoſe who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60687:92"/>addict themſelves unto an intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life, there is a great difference; for the ſoul of man becomes much more perfect by the knowledge and love of the truth of ſpirituall things then of corporall, eſpecially as they are exerciſed about the divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: hence it is that the life and powers of the ſoul of man become more perfect, the more it refrains from corporall objects, and imployes it ſelf in the contemplation and love of ſpirituall things, eſpecially of the divine Perfections. Now a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life aims chiefly at this, that neglecting all created objects whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirituall or corporall, it wholly imployes it ſelf in the contemplation and love of Almighty God, ſo that it becomes in a manner by an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall and affectionate union one and the Spirit with its divine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; wherefore, it being a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find a life more perfect
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60687:93"/>then that by which a man is united with his firſt cauſe, and his laſt end, it appears clearly that there can be no life more perfect then that of a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Morever, the righteous life of man, as he is man (as I have ſaid before) receives its value from the degree of reaſon which it exerciſes; wherefore, the more rationall it is, the greater is its worth and value: Therefore, ſeeing that thoſe which are true Chriſtians are unwilling to do any thing at all againſt reaſon, it muſt needs follow that their life farre excells the life of other Sects and Religions.</p>
                     <p>The virtuous life of man hath a chief regard unto that for which it was created, to wit, the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid perfections, for which is required a moſt pure ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mind; for if a mind be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to humane and ſenſuall paſſions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60687:93"/>it will be altogether unfit for ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and elevated an object; But there is no life to be found which more undreſſes the interiour powers of the ſoul of man, then that of Chriſtians, which ſpends its whole endeavours in uniting it ſelf onely with its Creatour: Therefore, there is none which ſurpaſſes it in true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity and excellency.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> There cannot be imagined the laſt end of any life better then that of Chriſtians.</head>
                     <p>TO the end I may make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there is no life to be compared with that of Chriſtians, we muſt know that there are two changes principally required to a virtuous life, to wit, a perfect end, and proportionable means for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60687:94"/>to that end. Firſt, I will ſhew that there is no end of the life of man, ſo conſonant to reaſon, at that which Chriſtians aim at; next I ſhall make appear that the means which Chriſtians are to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for the gaining their end, are the moſt accompliſhed and excellent of all others.</p>
                     <p>And as for the end, it will eaſily appear, if we daily conſider that there are two ſorts of ends of the life of man; the end <hi>cujus,</hi> or, of which, and the end <hi>quo,</hi> or, by which: that is the thing it ſelf which we ſeek, and the means by which we enjoy the ſame. Nothing que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe is ſo excellent as Almighty God; But God is the end of the life of Chriſtians, for whoſe ſake, and unto whom they addreſſe all their actions: This end therefore of theirs admits no colour of queſtion. Their faith alſo aſpires unto the clear viſion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60687:94"/>and fruition of Almighty God, not by the mediation of creatures, but immediately by his divine Eſſence. Now man by his clear intuition and fruition becoming united unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, arrives by the ſame unto his moſt conſummate and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme perfection, beyond which there remains not the leaſt object of any rationall deſire; Almighty God being that goodneſſe which plenarily ſatiates all the appetites of the ſoul of man.</p>
                     <p>It remains now that I ſhew by moſt pregnant and convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that the laſt bliſſe and felicity of man conſiſts in the clear intuition of the Divine perfections, for I have now proved that it cannot be attained unto in this life; and if we place it in the contemplation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, this not being had here, it is to be expected in the next life, where if it ſhall conſiſt in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60687:95"/>intellectuall poſſeſſing of the firſt verity not known by its own proper ſpecies or immediate objective in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, but by the intervention of effects or other repreſentatives there will ariſe many difficulties; for firſt it will not appear how mans intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall appetite will be fully ſatiated and wholly acquieſce in ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate contemplation, for if the ſoul of man in the ſtate of ſeparation from the body hath knowledge not onely of materiall objects, but of ſpirituall alſo, and immateriall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; either it hath this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge perfectly or imperfectly; if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly? by their intervention man cannot arrive unto the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and all things in the ſtate of imperfection have a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and appetite of their reſpective perfection (ſo the matter ſeeks its form, and that which is foul to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come beautifull) certainly the ſoul
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60687:95"/>of man as unſatisfied by ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect knowledge of its object, cannot be at quiet, which alſo may be ſeen in the endeavours of men, whoſe underſtanding not content with a confuſed and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, ſtrives by all labour and induſtry to arrive unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of them. If with a perfect knowledge they penetrate the effects, they are preſently infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a deſire to know their cauſes, for man naturally deſires true knowledge which conſiſts in the knowing the cauſes of things. That which is naturall cannot be taken from nature, and as naturall motion grows more impetuous and ſwift in the end, then it was in its bigin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; ſo mans underſtanding, the more perfectly it hath penetrated the effects, the more earneſtly doth it ſeek to know the cauſes of them; therefore, I do not ſee how the natural
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60687:96"/>appetite of mans underſtanding may be ſatisfied without the clear ſight of Almighty God, which alſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by experience, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of mans mind is not ſatisfied by any limitted object, beyond which it alwayes apprehends ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to remain unknown, whence it is that if any limitted dimenſion or number be preſuppoſed, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains alwayes a faculty of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to add ſomewhat further and further without end, and this is the nature of that infinity which the Mathemacians in their lines and numbers call the infinity of encreaſe or augment. Therefore all created ſubſtances being finite and limitted, our underſtanding never reſts ſatiated untill it behold the increated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Almighty God, which alone as being a pure act admits no bounds or circumſcription. It is therefore unreaſonable to prefix any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60687:96"/>other end of the life of man, then that which our faith hath eſtabliſhed (to wit) the clear viſion of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence. For it is manifeſt to all, that Almighty God is the laſt object in which the ſoul of man doth finally acquieſce. All naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tends to ſome laſt end or centre whither being arrived, it ceaſes. Now there being no created ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which the heart of man can fix its finall affection, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it onely reſts then when he ſhall behold face to face Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, then whom there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater, there can be nothing wanting in him to the full ſatiety of man; nor ſhall he further affect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour objects, becauſe he ſhall make no account of them. For there is no proportion between things limited and that which is infinite; as alſo becauſe there is no perfection in any effect, which is not more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60687:97"/>and eminently contained in the firſt cauſe, and conſequently there will be no further deſire of any thing, becauſe our underſtanding will be moſt compleatly perfected, as fully poſſeſſing its ſupreme and laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in the which it will moſt eaſily behold thoſe other inferiour things, towards which it is naturally incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and this is one difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the underſtanding and ſenſes, for the ſenſes in the fruition of their principall object are exhauſted and corrupted; but the underſtanding is thereby exceedingly perfected.</p>
                     <p>But here we muſt obſerve, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God being infinite, and above the ſphere of all cleated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that our underſtanding by its own proper forces, virtue, and energy cannot raiſe it ſelf ſo high as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the divine Eſſence; but there is neceſſary a ſupernaturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or quality called by Divines,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60687:97"/>the light of glory, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes in the next life into the ſouls which are free from all guilt of ſinne or pain, that be may thereby make them capable and fit for this beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call viſion. For Almighty God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſupplies neceſſities, nor can there be any thing elevated above its own proper ſphere, unleſſe it be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by ſome ſuperiour virtue; now the vigour alone of the moſt intenſe naturall light of our underſtanding, is no way ſufficient to produce the clear viſion of Almighty God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the excellence of the object preciſely does not elevate naturall power to an act of another kind, or of a ſuperiour nature, ſuch as is the beatificall viſion in regard of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted underſtanding, which therefore ought to be ſupplied with ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall diſpoſition or quality, which we call the light of Glory. Whence it appears, what a true and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60687:98"/>rationall judgement our Faith frames of the end of humane life and how eaſily it diſſolves the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of controverſie, in the which thoſe of other opinions find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly intangled, as in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Labyrinths. Where whatſoever we ſay either of the end <hi>cujus,</hi> or the end <hi>quo,</hi> there can be found none ſo good and rationall, no nor even imagined, as that which Chriſtians profeſſe and teach.</p>

                     <p>BEing now to treat of the means by which we are to arrive to the fore-mentioned ends, I ſhall make it appear that there is none which may rationally be compared with thoſe, which are approved by the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60687:98"/>Chriſtian Faith; for Almighty God doing nothing in vain, I ſuppoſe that no man can doubt, but man is to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto his laſt end, which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall beatitude, by ſome means or other; for that thing queſtionleſſe would be altogether vain and to no purpoſe which could not arrive unto the end for which it was ordained, as for example, the power of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in man would be in vain, had he no limbs, muſcles, and joynts to perform it, ſeeing therefore that man naturally thirſts after eternall bliſſe, if the means of attaining it ſhould be taken away, certainly his deſire of it would be altogether fruſtrate: Therefore there muſt be ſome means found, by which man is to arrive to this clear viſion of God, which is his end. This means Chriſtians call the purity of heart, and the divine Grace ſupernaturally infuſed into our ſouls, which makes them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60687:99"/>and enables them to operate and profit in all ſorts of virtues.</p>
                     <p>No man can deny but that the purity of heart is the means to raiſe our ſelves to the contemplation of the firſt Verity. I call the means that, which bears a proportion with the gaining the ends, and to the clear knowledge of God, there is exacted a great rapt or extaſie, he being the moſt ſupreme object of our underſtanding, and elevated farre above all things which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the ſenſes. Wherefore there is neceſſary a moſt exquiſite purity of mind, that is a ſovereign eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul from the love and affection of viſible and corporall things to the intenſe love of inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſpirituall objects; for that we call pure, which hath no mixture in it of any thing which is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour nature and quality: Now our underſtanding being ſeparated
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60687:99"/>from all corporall organs, and out ſoul being a ſpirituall and rationall ſubſtance, the more it abſtracts and raiſes it ſelf from corporall and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall things, and unites it ſelf with Divine objects, the more pure it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes. Whatever Philoſophers may have eſtabliſhed and taught of the purity of heart, of virtues, and of morall integrity is not onely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and taught by the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but by the ſame Religion there are found out new wayes and documents for the purifying our hearts with greater ſanctity. For that purity of heart, which is found out and gained by the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a mean no way proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the end which we have prefixed for Chriſtians; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exceeds the forces of any nature cannot be gained without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of another ſuperiour nature, even as water or any ponderous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60687:100"/>is not raiſed of it ſelf, but by the motion of another; but to ſee the divine Subſtance (as I have ſaid in the precedent Chapter) is above the ſphere of a created nature, and therefore every intellectuall nature operating according to its capacity, it muſt needs follow, that a created underſtanding cannot purifie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dregge it ſelf ſufficiently, unleſſe it be elevated by a ſuperiour aſſiſtance, and therefore the morall integrity and righteouſneſſe of which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have treated, bears not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proportion with the laſt end and ſupreme bliſſe of man. Hence it is that Chriſtians with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do attribute this proportion to Grace, and other virtues ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally infuſed by Almighty God, who is wanting to none in the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits neceſſary for the directing them, how with a moſt pure inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may arrive unto their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60687:100"/>wiſhed end. To prove which more at large is not for my preſent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded brevity, having manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in my Treatiſe <hi>Of the ſimplicity of a Chriſtian life,</hi> that it is not derived from a naturall love or imagination, or from the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon alone, or from any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall influence, or from any other ſpirituall creature, but from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſupernaturall gifts which Almighty God infuſes into our ſouls. Wherefore, not to repeat the ſame thing oftentimes, thoſe that are willing may read that Treatiſe, and ſee how Chriſtian life is a moſt perfect mean for the gaining the end of mans life, whence it muſt needs follow that there is no other life ſo good and abſolutely perfect as that of Chriſtians.</p>

For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour doth either practiſe, or is an expreſſion of the interiour; ſo that if the interiour be true, it is manifeſt that the exteriour is either a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call execution or expreſſion of the ſame verity, whilſt correſponding to the interiour, it is rightly termed a true exteriour worſhip, of which I ſhall hereafter treat more at large.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60687:101"/>God chiefly to exhibite a true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto him, and next for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our own true beatitude, it muſt follow that God is truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by Chriſtians, and that Chriſtians by ſo doing aim at their own bliſſe, which finally they are capable on; and conſequently thoſe which do perſevere unto the end in a true virtuous and Chriſtian life, may ſafely promiſe unto themſelves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bliſſe. Moreover, having plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heretofore demonſtrated a divine Providence over humane affairs, to which Providence it appertains to direct things to their proper ends by proportionable means, and there are no means which bear greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with eternall bliſſe then thoſe of a Chriſtian life; we may not doubt but whoever ſhall have led a Chriſtian life, (the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſtian Religion being the moſt perfect) ſhall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

                     <p>Further, if it be blaſphemy to impeach the divine Goodneſſe of Injuſtice, Chriſtians who obſerve this law cannot be fruſtrate of their bliſſe; for Almighty God being the authour or the firſt mover of all things to their proper ends, either he will promote ſome mortals to their beatitude, or none; if none, mans creation would be vain, and (as I have heretofore made appear) many abſurdities would follow: if ſome, then will he moſt juſtly preferre Chriſtians whom we know to be the moſt virtuous of all men.</p>
                     <p>For if Chriſtians ſhining before others in Piety and Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſtitute of their finall bliſſe, no man certainly muſt look for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if that which appears greater have no being at all, what may be expected of that which appears leſſe?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60687:102"/>As for Chriſtians, certainly they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have a greater proportion with their bliſſe then others, becauſe (as I have proved) they have leſſer impediments, and are more diſpoſed unto it; and therefore is the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith and Religion to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all others. And truly, if Chriſtians living according to the preſcript of their Religion become fruſtrate of their expected bliſſe, we muſt conclude that there is no ſuch thing, but a meer fable, a fiction, a chymera; for in naturall cauſes we ſee that they produce their ſeverall forms and effects, if they be not hindred, and the matter ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have in it congruous diſpoſitions, and ſhall the end and laſt form of a virtuous life, which is eternall bliſſe, to which no life is better diſpoſed then that of Chriſtianity, be denied, to that which is moſt habill and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed? Which if it be ſo, then truly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60687:103"/>there is no finall felicity of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I have ſhown) there is no other form of finall bliſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there is no laſt end of the life of man. Since therefore it would follow (the end being the meaſure, or rule of the means by which the end is gained) that man would be the moſt miſerable of all living creatures, and void of all order, would be ſubject to all caſualty, and deſtitute of all providence, which is the greateſt of all abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, I conclude therefore (that which I intended) that a Chriſtian life by true Religion, is a moſt ſafe and certain way to eternall bliſſe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The truth of Chriſtian Faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by being the cauſe of a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life.</head>
                     <p>HAving proved the Verity of Chriſtian Religion by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60687:103"/>grounded in the virtuous life of Chriſtians, now I intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the ſame out of the cauſes of the ſame life. The principall cauſes of this life is the Faith of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt Jeſus crucified, informed with Charity, that is, which works by love: the Scripture teaching us, <hi>Juſtitia Dei per fidem Jeſu Chriſti in omnes &amp; ſuper omnes qui credunt in eum:</hi> that is, The Juſtice of God is by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt for all and over all which believe in him: and without Faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God. This Faith of Chriſt informed, is that by which we beleeve that Chriſt crucified is true God, and true man, the Son of God identified in nature with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in perſon, whom we love above all things. Faith therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together with the love of Chriſt is the cauſe of the forementioned life.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60687:104"/>
                     <p>That it is ſo, daily experience teaches us, for that which is manifeſt cannot be denied, and of this we have a moſt palpable experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee Chriſtians make ſo much progreſſe in the righteouſneſſe of life, as they profit in the Faith of Chriſt; and on the contrary: for between theſe two ſorts is ſuch a ſtrict connexion, as they inferre a mutuall conſequence; and on the contrary, the defect of one inferres the loſſe of the other; for no ſooner grows a Chriſtian vitious of life, but the form of his Faith, which is Churity towards God vaniſhes, and on the contrary. If therefore we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the life of man ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which men have learned by their own and others experience to have conſtantly endured from the coming of our Saviour even unto theſe preſent times and that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do averre and teach the ſame,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60687:104"/>why ſhould we not out of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo important a matter play the Philoſophers, enquiring and ſearching into the cauſes of it, even as the Philoſophers having percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the effects of naturall things, and being ignorant of their cauſes began firſt to admire, and then by diſcourſe to ſearch into the cauſes of them?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, therefore there is no effect perfecter then its principall, or totall cauſe, of whom its perfection hath its dependance; if therefore the righteouſneſſe and verity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, which of all ſorts of life is the moſt excellent, hath its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Faith of Chriſt, it is not poſſible, but that Faith muſt be true; but if it be true, it follows that Chriſt is true God, and that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is true, which the Chriſtians profeſſe.</p>
                     <p>It is no leſſe impoſſible that that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60687:105"/>which is good, and true, hath its ſubſtantial dependance of that which is evill and falſe; for evill, as it is evill falſe, as it is falſe, is a certain nothing or a negation of the poſitive perfections of goodneſſe and verity; now if the Faith of Chriſt ſhould be falſe, and the love of him vitious, certainly the perfection of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an life which is known to be ſo good, could not ſubſtantially depend on that Faith and love which are evill, as it is clear.</p>
                     <p>Further, if the Faith of Chriſt were falſe, it would be the greateſt of all errours; for to affirm a man crucified to be true God, if it were not true, were an extreme madneſſe and folly; how could the life of Chriſtians therefore, it being moſt perfect, (as I have proved) proceed from ſo great an errour? Seeing that the inſtitution of a well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life is derived from, and grounded
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60687:105"/>in the framing a right conceit and underſtanding of it; and all errour in affection and morall actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from its in juſtice, and difformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the rule of equity.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the better any nature or ſubject is diſpoſed, the more is it facilitated for the receiving a more perfect form; but the form and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our underſtanding is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the diſpoſition for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of verity is a purity and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of heart, and therefore the more a man hath his mind undroſſed from the affection of creatures, the more it is prepared for the embracing verity, and rejecting that which is falſe; but I have proved, that there is no diſpoſition more undroſſed and purified, then that of a Chriſtian life; and therefore if the Chriſtian Faith were erroneous, none would more eaſily diſcern the deceit, then Chriſtians. But we behold the clean
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60687:106"/>contrary: for as they daily arrive to a more elevated degree of ſanctity, the more conſtantly and undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they aſſever its integrity; and as they grow more grounded in their Faith, their lives alſo increaſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whence it undoubtedly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that their Faith is true.</p>
                     <p>Almighty God, as he is the firſt mover, and firſt cauſe of all things, doth no leſſe produce and cauſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſpirituall things then he doth in materiall and corporall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cauſes motions in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will; and no man muſt doubt, but he affords the light of verity at leaſt of things neceſſary to the ſalvation of reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, more clearly to them who by their concurrence and ſanctimony of life become better diſpoſed for it. Now if virtuous and ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were erroneous in their Faith, they ſhould have no prerogative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60687:106"/>the vitious and ſinfull, but as miſled and blinded with many enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious deceits and errours would be given over to a reprobate ſenſe, which is quite contrary to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and preſent Providence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
                     <p>The end is the cauſe of the means which are ordained for the gaining it; wherefore, thoſe that erre in the end muſt needs go aſtray in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the means to attain it: for if the end in practicall things is as the principle and cauſe in things which are ſpeculative, ſeeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Chriſtians do not erre in the means which ſerve for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end, (to wit) in the virtue of their lives, but do farre excell all others, it follows they erre not in the end: But all aſſuredly confeſſe Chriſt to be their end; for they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrive to become moſt like unto him, and with all their endeavours
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60687:107"/>aim to enjoy him; therefore we muſt conclude that which they moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly profeſſe, that Chriſt crucified is true God.</p>
                     <p>The proceedings of Almighty God are alwayes ordinate, ordering things by his divine Wiſdome, ſo as that he governs the inferiour things by the ſuperiour; and hence he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinates nobler effects to nobler cauſes, for all cauſes muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter then their effects; now in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs there is no nobler effect then a Chriſtian life, which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt proceed from the moſt noble cauſe; now we ſee this wholly to flow from Chriſt, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt acknowledge to be the moſt perfect of all cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Secundary cauſes are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the primary or the Firſt cauſe, a Chriſtian life therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Chriſt as from his cauſe, we muſt confeſſe that Chriſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60687:107"/>being a man crucified is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of producing this excellent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſtian perfection; now if Chriſt were not alſo God as he taught himſelf to be, there could be no man more wicked and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and by this means Almighty God would uſe a moſt deteſtable inſtrument for the production of a virtuous life, which is extremely abſurd.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe being the meaſure of the effect, by how much the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the effect approaches nearer to the perfection of the cauſe, and becomes more like unto it, ſo much is it nearer its compleat and full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but we ſee the more like a man is to Chriſt Jeſus in his life, the more holy he becomes, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Divine, which were not poſſible, unleſſe he both were true God, and his Faith moſt intirely true.</p>
                     <p>We know cauſes by their effects,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60687:108"/>as we experience in medicines by their ſucceſſe; ſeeing therefore that Philoſophers leave behinde them unto poſterity the rules of a virtuous life, and yet very few of them have attained unto any conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection, notwithſtanding great endeavours done to that effect; nay, in the great abundance of the moſt excellent of them, none almoſt, without the direction of Chriſtian Faith, have been able to effect any thing; which yet we ſee in that ſhort time, and exactly to be brought to paſſe by Chriſtian Diſcipline in the congregation of the faithfull in every ſex and age: and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in deed there is no compariſon between Philoſophicall documents and the rules of Chriſtian life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Morality nor Religion. For what is more admirable, then that a moſt lewd and wicked man (as we are taught by daily examples
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60687:108"/>of all ages) as ſoon as he hath truly converted himſelf unto Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, becomes a new man, of proud and envious, humble and courteous; of covetous and ſordid, liberall and bountifull; of lewd and luxurious, becomes continent and chaſte, and as it were, with the principles of his Faith ſucks in the reſpective anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes for his particular vices, and with a manifold intereſt recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and repayes the debts of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vices; which never any ſect of Philoſophers hath attained unto: whence it neceſſarily follows, that Chriſt is the principall or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of it, and a medicine which reſtores all morality and produces a moſt perfect life in his faithfull.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> That Chriſtian Doctrine containing the Grounds of Faith is from God.</head>
                     <p>THe reading, hearing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of holy Scripture is the cauſe of Chriſtian perfection, and the ſubſtance of our Religion; for the verity of Scripture is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, and therefore the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Faith are thoſe which are drawn out of holy Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>We know that in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man there is no determinate knowledge of future contingencies, of which we can frame no acts nor ſcience, which made the moſt famous and learned of all Philoſophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that men could have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of future things ſubject to chance; and to have it was proper onely to Almighty God, who being
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60687:109"/>eternall, comprehends in his eternity all things, the which are clearly laid open to his underſtanding, and of the which men cannot arrive unto the knowledge unleſſe they be revealed unto them by Almighty God: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that the holy Scripture almoſt every where, but chiefly in the Old Teſtament, doth foretell future contingencies, which depend on mens free-will, not onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall terms, but moſt exactly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto particulars, and that not thoſe of one, ten a hundred, or a thouſand years, but hath foretold thoſe of two three, and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; and not onely thoſe which befell unto the Jews, and thoſe which were to be done by Chriſt his Spouſe the Church: but as it were foretold all the proſperities and adverſities which ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to almoſt all Nations: as the Aſſyrians, Chaldeans, Perſians,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60687:110"/>Medes Greeks, Romans, and the reſt; and that juſt as it was foretold it moſt exactly came to paſſe; we muſt neceſſarily confeſſe that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures came from God, and were not written by the induſtry and wit of men, and therefore thoſe which as yet remain to be fulfilled, are to be held moſt infallible; as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſame Spirit who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told thoſe others which have ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably beyond all imagination been accompliſhed. And hence we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather, that Almighty God hath a moſt ſpeciall care of men, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes his divine Providence about humane affairs.</p>
                     <p>The foreſeeing then of future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies appertaining onely to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, humane induſtry and ſagacity cannot ſo order and diſpoſe ſuch combination of affairs, as the heroicall enterprizes and warlike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of famous men, but oftentimes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60687:110"/>do beyond all expectation light on moſt unexpected and variable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. God onely therefore can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine theſe actions of men ſo that they may be ſigns of what is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in future ages; but we ſee how thoſe things which are already brought to paſſe in the new Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or ſhall hereafter follow, are deciphered and delineated under moſt proper types and figures in the Old Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Nor can it rationally be ſaid that thoſe interpretations are vainly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or feigned by Chriſtians, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed without ground, becauſe in ſo great a variety of things and times, in ſo manifold a compoſition of words, and in ſo great a diverſity of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours and ſacred Writers, there could not be ſo exact an uniformity of the Old Law with the New, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſome underſtanding and divine Providence had framed a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60687:111"/>of things which were to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in their due times: nor can it be ſaid that it was done by chance, for there cannot be found the leaſt thing which is diſſonant, impertinent, or diſcompoſed, but every thing with an equall tenour and moſt ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony makes up the concord; ſo that that which is obſcurely toucht in one place, in another is found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, ſo as the whole Scripture may ſeem to explicate it ſelf; this if it be unknown to thoſe which are ignorant of holy Scriptures it is farre otherwiſe with thoſe who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched their underſtandings with the treaſures gathered out of the moſt ſincere fountain of Verity: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſire to know the truth, let them with piety, humility and purity ſearch into the ſame fountain of holy Scriptures, and queſtionleſſe they will be of our opinion.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore Allegoricall Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60687:111"/>agrees onely to holy Scripture, becauſe this alone is that which hath deſcended from Almighty God, as he exerciſed his all-ſeeing and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Wiſdome. I call an Allegory not the fabulous Interpretations Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets uſe, (and we alſo do expound Parables without an Allegory) nor a parabolicall and literall ſenſe, which we uſe when in a fable or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, we do not intend to ſignifie that which is couched under the bare notion of the words, but onely that which is raiſed in our conceits by thoſe words, and hath a further ſenſe. But an Allegoricall ſenſe we call that which contains three things: firſt, that without all fiction accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the proper ſignification of the words, the hiſtory both concerning the words, actions, and relations be plainly and ſincerely recounted. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that there be ſome future thing ſignified by that thing which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60687:112"/>is done at preſent. Thirdly, that thoſe things which are done, be ſo fitly diſpoſed and ordered, that when they are put in execution there appear in them an inſinuation of their future correlatives: whence it is maniſeſt, that no created induſtry could ever couch ſuch a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things in this ſenſe but onely the divine Providence, which had an infallibility of all future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the manner of ſpeech and context of holy Scripture is ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that it could not have been uſed by any the moſt excellent and skilfull of all Chriſtians, although they were moſt exerciſed in all kind of knowledge; for this manner of order and expreſſion was onely gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them unto whom the holy Ghoſt vouchſafed to dictate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire it, becauſe, although there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded ſeverall diſtances of times
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60687:112"/>between thoſe Hagiographers or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writers, and alſo ſome of them uſed more elegance of writing; yet the ſubſtance of the expreſſion was alwayes the ſame in all, which is a manifeſt ſign that it was not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but Divine.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is alſo approved by the effects, by which we gather the virtue of the cauſe; for (as I have already ſhewed both in this book, and in another of the ſimplicity of a Chriſtian life) there is no nobler ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then a Chriſtian life, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed out of any inferiour and created cauſe, but onely from the free gift and liberall hand of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, ſeeing therefore that that Doctrine is the chief inſtrument of a Chriſtian life in which the whole form of Chriſtian Religion doth conſiſt, it clearly appears, that the ſame, and even the manner of ſpeech could not be Humane but Divine:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60687:113"/>for experience teaches, that humane learning little avails mankind to a happy and bleſſed life, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this light appeared to the world, it was wholly drowned in a dark night of vices and confuſion; but after the rayes of Apoſtolicall Doctrine diſplayed themſelves, and the ſound of Evangelicall Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was heard, all thoſe clouds and miſts were diſperſt, and the minds of men repleniſhed with thoſe beams became reſplendent with a moſt ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſerenity of truth and virtue.</p>
                     <p>But in caſe that ſome ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ſo long ſince paſt, I will relate ſome domeſticall examples of my own experience; for I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced that men have been by this divine Doctrine and the manner of it more illuminated, delighted, and converted, then by any other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the Preachers of our times neglecting this ſacred Doctrine, have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60687:113"/>betaken themſelves to Philoſophical proportions and Rhetoricall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they have profited their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours very little, or nothing at all; whereas heretofore making uſe in their Sermons of a plain manner of ſpeech, and content onely with the inſtruction and textuall frequence of holy Scripture, they have wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inflam'd the minds of their hearers, who were ſo mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, that both in proſperity and adverſity they did expreſſe their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee of mind, whence they were wonderfully ſtirr'd up to leade moſt bleſſed and virtuous lives.</p>
                     <p>I call God to witneſſe that I have been oftentimes preaching unto the people, when I have made digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to prove the profundity of the ſacred Text unto the wits of this age; to the learneder ſort by Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſubtilties, and humane learning: I have plainly perceived out of a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60687:114"/>certain impatience and averſion of my Auditory very little attention in them; and this not onely of the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ignorant but even of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſort: but as ſoon as I turned my ſelf again unto the Majeſty of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, either in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divers ſenſes, or in the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hiſtories, I have ſeen an admirable attention in every one, all fixing their eyes upon me as if they had not been living creatures, but meer ſtatues.</p>
                     <p>Yea, I have experienced, that when omitting other queſtions I have inſiſted upon the Expoſition of ſacred Scripture my Auditory hath been ſo delighted ſo illuſtrated, and verity appearing ſo touched to the quick by Divine influence, that they have immediately reform'd their lives, inſomuch that being delighted with no other reading, or hearing any other thing renou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60687:114"/>delights and appetites, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves up daily more and more, they have lived lives more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine then humane. And what I now affirm happen'd farre more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in thoſe Primitive Ages, when Chriſtian Religion was but newly planted.</p>
                     <p>This is that Doctrine which is more piercing then the two-edged ſword; which imbeliſhed the whole with virtues, which defaced the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the devils, and demoliſhed the profane Oracles of their Idols; this is that which hath diſperſed a world of errours, and hath been ſo fruitfull of all ſorts of wonders as I will hereafter declare.</p>
                     <p>Our underſtanding the more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified it is, the more capable it is of Verity; and hence it is that ſo many moſt excellent and elevated wits, have not onely extolled the praiſes of this Doctrine by their writings,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60687:115"/>but giving teſtimony of it by their preaching, life, and manners, have not doubted to ſpend their lives in its defence, which certainly they would no way have done, had they not ſeen almoſt a ſenſible and ocular evidence of its verity.</p>
                     <p>Further, truth gives teſtimony of truth, and falſity is the cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; other diſciplines, arts, and faculties are not contrary, but as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto this; whence moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and skilfull Doctours, who are moſt verſed and exerciſed in all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, do moſt conſtantly maintain, that there is no part of Philoſophy which is repugnant or inconſiſtant, nay, which is not moſt fitly cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with it; and therefore it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Chriſtians to imploy their indeavours in the gaining of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which would no way be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, if it were detrimentary unto the Catholique Faith: there are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60687:115"/>onely ſome few ſubject to ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are forbidden, as that of Divination, being no leſſe pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then unprofitable; which by the learnedſt, even of the Philoſophers, are hiſſed at, derided, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as not to be accounted amongſt the Arts and Sciences. And if at any time there appear any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between Philoſophicall and Chriſtian Principles, they are ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly reconciled by our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, that it clearly appears, that all Philoſophy is but the ſervant and hand-maid of the ſacred Doctrine; for the eaſie diſſolving of objections is the certain ſign of Verity.</p>
                     <p>It is the nature of Verity, that the more it is impugned, the more (if it have a fit champion) is it brought to light, becauſe our underſtanding having Verity for its object, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined unto it, as to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perfection, and where the more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60687:116"/>it ſhines, with greater delight it is embraced; but then Verity appears moſt, when it is moſt ſharply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, becauſe in the very diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conflict of diſputation it manifeſts it ſelf. Seeing therefore that Chriſtian Doctrine having been ſo vehemently impugned by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Philoſophers and Tyrants, hath alwayes remained invincible and victorious, which the infinite vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of Chriſtians teſtifie, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent that its truth proceeded from Almighty God; otherwiſe in ſo many conflicts it had not ſo long remain'd unconquer'd.</p>

                     <p>AS Faith and the reading holy Scriptures, Auſcultation, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60687:116"/>Meditation is the principall cauſe of a Chriſtian life, ſo Prayer is its principall nouriſhment where it hath its growth and perfection: for by long experience we have found in our Religion, that all thoſe who profit in our Religion, and have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the higheſt degrees of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity have attained it by frequent and continuall Prayer; and we have obſerved, that they have taken ſuch guſt and complacence in it, that they have deſpiſed all other humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights as vile, abject, and unworthy of them. Nor doth this happen one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the moſt eminent and learned ſort of thoſe which flouriſh in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity but it is commonly found in the ſimple and ignorant, as well men as women, and even in all thoſe who have learned to leade a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an life. By this effect therefore we may prove the Verity of out Faith.</p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60687:117"/>
                     <p>Almighty God being a pure Act, the firſt Verity, and an infinite Light, the nearer a man makes his approach unto him, the more abundartly doth he partake this Purity, Verity, and Light; But man doth not make his approach unto Almighty God by corporall paces, but by the purity of life, elevation of mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Verity: Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there can be no life more candid and more ſincere, then that of Chriſtians; and that then the mind of man is moſt pure, when it is wrapt up in a ſoaring and exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall contemplation of the Divine perfections, it follows, that man is moſt poſſeſſed of this Verity and Light, as he is in the very act of prayer and contemplation: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we find by experience, that Chriſtians as they encreaſe in the fervour of Devotion and frequency of Prayer, are more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60687:117"/>in their Faith, and inflamed with the love of Chriſt, and profit in virtue we muſt confeſſe that the Faith, Verity, and Light of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is Divine. Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding affecting Verity as its proper perfection, and abhorring Falſity as its greateſt enemy; man is in nothing ſo diſpoſed for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Verity and rejecting of contraries as in the very act of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Contemplation; by which he doth moſt ſtedfaſtly and ardently embrace the documents of Faith, which therefore cannot be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, all Chriſtians in their Prayers to Almighty God, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to grant that for the which they pray, by the merits of Chriſt; for in the end of every prayer they moſt commonly adde ſome ſuch form, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> or, <hi>Through Chriſt our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60687:118"/>Lord</hi> and yet they obtain admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incredible graces from him; which if any ſhould not believe, yet certainly they muſt grant that which by daily experience is manifeſt, that they obtain that which they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſeek after, the righteouſneſſe of a virtuous life, the quiet and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of mind; ſo as they preferre the pious tears of Devotion farre before any delights and pleaſures of the world. Now certainly if Chriſt were not he whom our Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims him to be, they could not in ſo great a ſerenity of mind, and at ſo near a diſtance of ſo great a light be environed and buried in ſo great a darkneſſe; nor would Almighty God permit them to be ſo groſly deceived, or at leaſt, if they were obſtinate in an errour, he would not grant their petitions.</p>
                     <p>Again, every cauſe diſpoſing its matter for the producing its effect,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60687:118"/>after it hath introduced its laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, immediately produces it, nor would it diſpoſe the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it meant to Introduce the form; nor any cauſe of motion would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, if it intended not ſome end of the motion produced; but a juſt man unleſſe he were invited and drawn on by Almighty God, who is the firſt cauſe of all things, could not elevate his mind unto him by prayer. Bliſſe therefore being the end of prayer and a virtuous life, Almighty God would not induce man unto thoſe means of prayer and virtue, unleſſe he intended to make him finally bleſſed. If therefore Chriſtians makig progreſſe in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and prayers become more groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſettled in their Faith and Contemplation of Chriſt, their Faith cannot be but from Almighty God, by which he leades men unto bliſſe.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60687:119"/>
                     <p>Every cauſe grants (as I may ſay) unto its effect what it asks; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect asks of its cauſe its due and proper perfections, which then it is ſaid to exact, when it is rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: for then the cauſe, if not otherwiſe hindred, delaies not the execution of the effect, infuſing that quantity of perfection into it, which the degree of diſpoſition doth exact; which immediate execution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of its facility and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which of its nature is deſirous to communicate it ſelf. Almighty God therefore being the moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign good, queſtionleſſe will more then other cauſes which have not ſo great goodneſſe grant the petitions to this effect eſpecially unto thoſe which are beſt diſpoſed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his favours as are Chriſtians, chiefly when they are in the act of Prayer and Contemplation; but Chriſtians ask nothing more then the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60687:119"/>light of truth, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Ill umina oculos meos nè unquam obdormiam in morte:</hi> Enlighten my eyes that I never ſleep in death. And therefore Almighty God never denies them their requeſt; but Chriſtians the more they pray, the more they are confirmed in their Faith, therefore this our diſcourſe is of greater force.</p>
                     <p>Further, if Chriſt were not God, to profeſſe himſelf ſo would be the moſt ſupreme degree of blaſphemy and deteſtation that could be. Now if Chriſtians do pray to God the Father through Chriſt, whom they believe to be of the ſame nature with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, how doth Almighty God permit them in ſo great an errour ariſing out of ignorance and ſimplicity, and doth not draw them out of it, knowing that they ſerve him with their whole affection, and humbly beg of him
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60687:120"/>the knowledge of truth? or if their obſtinacy be in fault, why doth he leave ſo great a wickedneſſe and treaſon againſt his Divine Majeſty unrevenged? or why doth he (as we ſee him) favour this errour and impiety? whilſt beſtowing ſo many and great gifts on them he queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe grants them that which they ask at his hands.</p>
                     <p>Our ſoul (as I have ſaid) doth chiefly delight in Verity, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, perplexed and confounded with Falſity, in which it can take no reſt; if therefore the Faith of Chriſt were falſe, there would be no impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſo abſurd and peſtilent as it; for how ſhould innumerable men, eſpecially juſt and wiſe-men, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt crucified, that for this alone they ſhould deſpiſe all humane affairs, and ſhould not onely moſt willingly ſuffer want of ſuſtenance,

Now I will briefly run over the externall cauſes, which ſerve as inſtruments and props of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, to wit, the Sacraments and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60687:121"/>Ceremonies inſtituted in order to them, all which appertain unto the exteriour worſhip of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and that I may not ſpend time about every one in particular, I will treat of them altogether, as the different members of one and the ſame body. For all ſacramentall Ceremonies, and even the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments having a reference unto the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, they may be rightly ſtyled one thing.</p>
                     <p>From this externall worſhip, if it be rightly obſerved, we ſee that Chriſtians gain great improvement in their Devotion and Sanctity, for we ſee by daily experience even from the beginning of our Religion, to theſe very times by the records, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and examples both of the Primitive and Modern Fathers, that thoſe which piouſly and exactly practiſe this exteriour worſhip, and do often adminiſter or receive thoſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60687:121"/>Sacraments and divine Myſteries, or do take upon them ſome one, which before they had not, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in perfection, and become daily more divine by their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſanctity; and thoſe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary which do in a cuſtomary way, without Faith and Religion famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly and accuſtomarily frequent them, become the worſt of all men; which moſt plainly appears (to omit the examples of antiquity) in the Prieſts and Clergy of our times, then whom, if good, none better; but if evill, none are found more wicked and pernicious. For the good, as void of all affection to temporall things, onely inſiſt in the worſhip of Almighty God, for whoſe ſake and Faith they doubt not to ſpend their lives; thoſe which are bad are ſo exceſſive in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, ſo puft up with pride, envy, avarice, and ſo overwhelmed with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60687:122"/>all vices, that as altogether loſt, and which is worſt of all, they know not how to think of amendment, and then chiefly, when by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reprehenſion, exhortation, and good examples, by which others are wont to enter into themſelves, they become more harſh, refractory and intractable. Theſe things being ſo and as preſent before our eyes, being no way refragable, we muſt ſeek the reaſon why two ſuch contrary effects proceed from the ſame Ceremonies of the ſame Sacraments. Now it is not repugnant to Philoſophy that two contrary effects proceed from one and the ſame cauſe, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſubjected have contrary diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; for the earth by the beams and heat of the funne of ſoft becomes hard, and ice by the ſame of hard is diſſolved into a liquid humour. A tree, whilſt it ſtands rooted in the earth, by influence of the Planets
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60687:122"/>bringeth forth bloſſomes and fruit, and by the ſame influence when it is rooted up, it withers: and truly thoſe effects being ſo oppoſite, that the one is moſt excellent in thoſe which perform thoſe ſacred Myſteries (as (I have ſaid) with due veneration; the other moſt pernicious in thoſe which do abuſe them, they cannot proceed from any vain or falſe cauſe; &amp; this not appearing ſo in men of any other Religion, there can be no other reaſon of it given, but their different and contrary worſhip of Almighty God; for if the exteriour worſhip of Chriſtian Religion did not depend of God himſelf, and did not contain in it ſelf that divine Virtue and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſuch a manner as inſtruments do contain the virtue of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe, they would no way be able to produce, increaſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the moſt excellent effect of Chriſtian ſanctity. This exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60687:123"/>worſhip cannot produce this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of its own proper force, becauſe Chriſtian life being wholly ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and conſiſting in the intellectuall part of man, cannot ſubſtantially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from corporall inſtruments: for what can Baptiſme, the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with oil and balm, the uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, the oblation of Bread and Wine, the Altars, and other ſuch extrinſecall things of their own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, conduce to the perfection of the ſoul, unleſſe they were the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome ſuperiour cauſe? For if theſe were introduced for a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious worſhip by any humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or diabolicall impoſture, a life ſo holy would never proceed from ſo wicked and vain illuſions.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may object that this worſhip is not the cauſe of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather the exerciſe of virtues and credulity of men, by which they believe it to be divine: for the good
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60687:123"/>ſtriving daily by their virtues to root out their vices, do every day more then other grow perfect by thoſe exerciſes. But we now ſeek the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why others who are ſtudious in the diſciplines of virtue and mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who either do not make uſe of theſe Sacraments, or do a long time refrain from the uſe of them, do ſwerve ſo farre from the integrity they aim at? Truly, if this worſhip were unprofitable or falſe, the more one ſhould recede from it and caſt it away, the more he would profit in the exerciſe of morall virtues: Prieſts alſo by deriding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning it would not grow more vicious, but more virtuous, the contrary of which daily experience teacheth.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Almighty God being the ſupreme Verity, the more one is illuminated by him, the nearer he approaches unto him; but the more
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60687:124"/>a man is involved with falſity and errours, the farther he becomes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from him: Now we know that thoſe, who with Piety and Religion do frequent thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are ſo vehemently delighted with this Divine Worſhip, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes rapt out of themſelves with the aſtoniſhment of their corporall part they remain immoveable, and their faces caſting forth reſplendent rayes of ſanctity make them no leſſe amiable then venerable; which though it happen'd oftner in the Primitive Ages (as we reade) then now-adayes it doth, yet there are not wanting thoſe whom we know, which enjoy thoſe priviledges, and thoſe not onely of the learneder ſort, but of the ſimple and vulgar people. Whence therefore is this kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie? whence this abſorpt and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant contemplation? whence this ſervour of a ſpirit inflamed? thoſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60687:124"/>ſcalding lights, and ſweet ſhowers of devout tears? whence this ineffable jubilee of the Church melodiouſly rejoycing in her Hymns and Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? Truly, unleſſe this worſhip were from God, and conſequently true, there would be no where found ſo many dreams and lyes, it being wholly in a manner compacted of Types and myſterious Figures. For what ever is contained in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Sacraments, Temples, Altars, Mytres, Veſtments, in all the world of Ceremoniall Rites, in the modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Hymns, and in the reſt of the ſpirituall appurtenances would be a meer vanity and labour loſt; all which, nevertheleſſe, are inſtituted for the worſhip of Chriſt. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this worſhip were ſuſtained by the means of falſities, men, at leaſt the wiſer and more perſpicacious wits, would not out of the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Sacraments be ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60687:125"/>elevated to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine objects, nor reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſo great and celeſtiall delight; for the underſtanding (as I have ſaid) by falſities becomes more uncertain and dull, and at a greater diſtance from Almighty God; wherefore out of the contrary effect, we gather that this worſhip is true, and repleniſhed with Divine graces and favours.</p>
                     <p>The order alſo and ſignification of the things which are performed in the Church, ſhew clearly that it is no humane invention but a divine diſpoſition; for there is nothing in this worſhip irrational nothing vain, but every thing hath its order and proper myſtery, of which I ſhall not now ſpeak in particular, although in the third book I ſhall touch ſome, as the neceſſity of the ſubject will require. If any one deſires more fully to be ſatisfied of this Verity,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60687:125"/>let him revolve the explanations of the Fathers, where ſeriouſly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one in particular, he ſhall never be ſatiated with admiration, to find in theſe Ceremonies no leſſe order and harmony then in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall work of Nature, and ſhall receive moſt excellent contentment and dilatation of heart; and if he be not of a perverſe and obſtinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and have a mind wholly darkned, he ſhall be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that all thoſe things are from God, and not invented and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men.</p>

                     <p>I Have hitherto proved to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of my mean ability the Verity of Chriſtian Faith by Arguments
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60687:126"/>drawn out of both the internall and externall cauſes of a Chriſtian life, now therefore I judge it fit to prove the ſame by deſcending to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it; one of the principall effects, and immediately ſubſequent in that is, the peace and quiet of mind, the joy and liberty of the ſoul: for beſides thoſe examples which we reade and hear of our Authours and Predeceſſours, it is plainly ſeen in our age, that true Chriſtians are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the bruſhes and ſtorms of perſecution, but do perſevere more immoveable in the Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt then before, and even glory in their tribulations and ſufferings: we are to ſearch therefore whence theſe effects proceed, and how it happens that the more they follow Chriſt in the perfection of their lives, they attain unto the greater liberty and ſerenity of mind.</p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60687:126"/>
                     <p>Chriſtians themſelves affirm this to be the reaſon of it, becauſe (ſay they) this bliſſe of man conſiſting onely in our knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Divine objects, it is manifeſt that the deſire and appetite of man cannot be bounded or limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any ultimate and laſt end, which is not God himſelf: The qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et (therefore) and peace of mind that Chriſtians poſſeſſe cannot proceed from any other thing, then that they have prefixt unto themſelves that laſt end which of all others is the true one; whence if you ſhould ask all Chriſtians, what was their ſupreme end to which they aim at, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all would anſwer, that it was Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; and therefore eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all worldly things as nothing in compariſon of God, and hoping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their tranſitory life to obtain and enjoy him, they contemne and ſet at naught whatever the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60687:127"/>Hence it is, that being bereft and deſpoil'd of their worldly goods, they are not contriſtated; when care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of their lives, they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to death, that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Almighty God, their onely and ſupreme good: and as God is every where by his Eſſence, Preſence, and Power, ſo is he in them alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by love and contemplation as the thing beloved is ſaid to be in the party that loves. Now when the thing beloved is preſent, the mind of him that loves is delighted, and rejoyceth; and therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who live virtuouſly are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely delighted with the preſence of Almighty God, whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally do perceive as preſent. And becauſe God is an infinite Power, when they experience his ſavours, ſlighting all other things, they fear nothing; and in this manner being armed with great liberty and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60687:127"/>they are not drawn from their purpoſes and reſolves neither by fair means, nor by any terrours whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But a man not being able by his naturall forces by reaſon of the ſenſuall impediments and weakneſſe of his underſtanding to arrive unto this ſerenity and liberty of mind, we muſt neceſſarily (ſay they) confeſſe that this tranquillity and peace of mind is beſtowed upon us as a moſt ſupernaturall and divine gift, by virtue of which Almighty God and our eternall bliſſe is daily before our eyes.</p>
                     <p>That that is the true cauſe of peace, joy, and liberty of mind in the Chriſtians it is plain, our ſoul being one of the ſame, and having all its powers radicated in the eſſence of it, as often as it is wholly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the intenſe operation of ſome one power, it cannot uſe the ſervice of another but very remiſly; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60687:128"/>If one be in an intenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, he is not expedite in the uſe of the other powers of his ſoul; and if one be in great pain, he is not at the ſame time fit for contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if therefore Chriſtians were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their Faith as by a vain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, no virtue of their ſuperiour cauſe would affiſt them to confirm ſo great an errour, and ſo they would be left onely to their naturall perfections, nay, even thoſe would be much impair'd by ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of Verity; how therefore could they ſo inviolably preſerve ſo great a peace, joy, and liberty of mind amongſt ſo many calamities and oppreſſions, eſpecially ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally retain it, as not onely a few, but innumerable do? For the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers vaunt of one or two at moſt which they pretend amongſt them to have had this peace, quiet, and joy of mind; but we can produce
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60687:128"/>infinite of both ſexes which in all parts of the world have poſſeſſed the tranquillity and liberty of mind in moſt exceſſive tribulations and torments, and this onely by invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, praiſing, and glorifying Chriſt crucified. Moreover, we have found by the experience of our anceſtours, and our own, that this peace, joy, and liberty of mind is augmented by the increaſe of Faith, and ſanctimony of a Chriſtian life, which certainly would not be ſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there was expected by Faith, Hope, and the true Profeſſion of them, a true and ſolid good; for as a man profits more in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, ſo is he brought more into the knowledge and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth and good which he ſeeks by eſchewing the contraries, and therefore if Chriſtians had not found a ſolid good in the perfection of their lives, their joy would not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60687:129"/>be increaſed by it, but rather decreaſe as they ſhould find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it.</p>
                     <p>This is very well confirmed out of the life of the religious, for to omit examples of paſt Ages (which I cannot compriſe in this ſhort Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe) we daily ſee innumerable both men and women do betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtrict Cloiſters out of the deſire of a more perfect life, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their parents, kindred, friends, riches, and all pleaſures together with their own liberty to live with ſtrangers and externs, to whom they become ſo ſubject and obedient, that as for exteriour ſubſiſting and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they enjoy none, but thoſe which by the command of their ſuperiours are permitted them, as preciſely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their livelihood, and thoſe to be changed and ſubſtracted as things though common to all, yet uncertain to every one in particular;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60687:129"/>but as for the corporall perfections, they keep the chaſtity of their mind and body moſt incorrupted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, ſubduing their carnall and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall appetites, by watching, faſting, abſtinence, and other mortifications. And as for the perfections of the mind, of which liberty is the chief, they renounce of their own accord all the uſe of it with a perpetuall and moſt ſtrict obligation, conforming themſelves wholly to the will and diſpoſition of their ſuperiours. Thus having forſaken all the goods which mortalls are wont to call theirs, to rejoyce in, and be delighted with, all theſe who aſpire to this perfection live ſo contented and joyful, that one would think they had even the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all pleaſures and delights, and by daily profiting in this way they become more full of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and alacrity, rejoycing and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing onely in the praiſes of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60687:130"/>Chriſt crucified; and if one ſhould ask why they did ſo, they all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly would anſwer, that all their joy and delight is placed in Chriſt Jeſus, and in thoſe things which have dependance of him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore I ſay that no man can with reaſon ſuſpect that this ſhould proceed out of folly, ſeeing it hath been the continuall practice not onely of humble and ſimple men, but of innumerable eminent Saints and Doctours who would eaſily by reaſon of their wiſdome and ſanctity diſcern the errour and folly of it, if it were vain and erroneous, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and errour cannot any long time conſiſt with wiſdome and virtue; ſuch men ſtriving to attain unto the heighth of perfections, there being none greater then that which they aim at (to wit) a Chriſtian religious life, of which that ſtate is accounted the higheſt and ſupreme degree, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60687:130"/>there are none more apt then they to receive celeſtiall illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If therefore the Faith were not true, queſtionleſſe the vanity and deceit of it in many Ages, in ſo great a concourſe of people of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially by ſuch wiſe and virtuous men had ere this been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, nor had ſuch men been able in ſo holy a ſervitude to preſerve ſo great a peace and tranquillity of mind, and perpetually to take ſuch comfort and joy in it. The contrary of which is manifeſt, for theſe are they who by their words and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience have confirmed, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it by their Writings, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet free, and onely ſubject to the graces and favours of Almighty God, do enjoy a moſt perfect peace and tranquillity of mind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all kind of deceit is farre diſtant from the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Every cauſe moved by its own
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60687:131"/>goodneſſe, which it ſeeks to extend and communicate, doth, as much as it may poſſible, direct its effect to its proper end, eſpecially, when the effect is diſpoſed for it, to which the more it approacheth, the more it is delighted and doth acquieſce in it. Now God is ſupremely good, and a moſt liberall and bountifull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of his own goodneſſe, and therefore he directs all his effects, which are well diſpoſed, to their proper and deſerved ends, that they may take up their final reſt in them. Now there being no more intenſe diſpoſition for the end of man then that of moſt approved and religious men, he will queſtionleſſe direct them unto their wiſhed end in which they obtain their deſired reſt in the enjoying their end; but theſe by their daily progreſſe are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the orthodox Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in Chriſt Jeſus, do bend
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60687:131"/>their whole endeavours in gaining him alone, ſetting all other things at naught. Whence it appears, that there is no errour or falſity in this Faith, otherwiſe, by the Divine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, by forſaking more and more this falſe delight of mind, they would be directed to their true and wiſhed for end and tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>All joy is grounded in ſome love or other, for love is the firſt act of the will or rationall appetite; from which the other acts have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flunce. The joy therefore and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee of mind, which doth moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly appear in the countenances of thoſe men, not conſiſting in any tranſitory, fading, or naturall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſoul, and all of them affirming with one voyce and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, that it proceeds from the love of Chriſt crucified, cannot be grounded in any errour or vain affection becauſe, the more uprightly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60687:132"/>and holily ſuch men did live, the more it would decay in them; for (as I have ſaid) if the Faith of Chriſt were falſe, they would daily more apparantly perceive, that in their prepoſterous affections they were wholly deceived, and thence they would become more heavy and ſorrowfull, but the ſincerity of their deportments, the chearfulneſſe of their countenances, that refulgent kind of ſanctity in their exteriour, for which they are in ſuch reverence and veneration of all men, ſhew it to be farre otherwiſe, whilſt we may ſee them alwayes in all events more pleaſant, content and joyfull.</p>

                     <p>ANother effect of Chriſtian life is gathered from the exteriour
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60687:132"/>man, from their manners and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, which is in a manner a ſign and argument of a certain kind of Divinity, by reaſon of which many are even enforced to eſteem and reverence them: whence the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable aſpect of humble men have blunted and affrighted the proud and fierce minds of Tyrants; which we reade of that powerfull and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous King of the Hunns, <hi>Attila,</hi> though he could be ſatisfied by no ſlaughter or maſſacre of men, nor terrified by any power of enemies, yet at Ravenna, a Speech of S. <hi>Leo</hi> Pope ſet him packing out of Italy, and he contrary to his wonted cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and not without the great admiration of his followers, ſeemed not onely to reverence the venerable Biſhop, but to obey him in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner commanding him. And in like manner <hi>Totilas</hi> the cruel Emperour of the Gothes, after he had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60687:133"/>ſo many thouſands by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maſſacres, waſted and conſumed whole Nations, not being able to ſuffer the countenance of S. <hi>Bennet</hi> a poor Monk, fell down proſtrate on his face, and could ſcarce raiſe himſelf, when the ſervant of God commanded and aſſiſted him to riſe. In like manner <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour returning to Millain after his cruel ſlaughter of the Theſſalonians, was by the authority of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> chiding him, and reviling his cruelty, denied the entrance into the Church, untill he had by a publick penance enjoyn'd him by the Biſhop, expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his cruelty and injuſtice. I ſhould want time, if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the examples in this kind; but it is not for my preſent purpoſe to prove that which by daily examples is known to all, for I have often ſeen arrogant and wicked men in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the holy and virtuous, both
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60687:133"/>to have changed their words, and with great ſorrow and compunction of heart to have reformed their lives. For the divine Spirit doth adorn the exteriour both of men and women, the younger with a wonderfull ſweetneſſe and grace, the elder men with the veneration of their white hairs, and makes them as the preſent matter requires, to become now amiable to ſome, and now again to ſome others formidable.</p>
                     <p>This effect in the exteriour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of the ſupernaturall bounty of the mind, that is, out of the grace of God adorning the underſtanding, will, and other powers of the ſoul, which we gather hence, that our ſoul vehemently altering our bodies by force of the imagination doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly change the countenance and viſage: as by laſcivious thoughts the body is ſtirred up to luſt, and by the inſtigation of hatred it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60687:134"/>with deſire of revenge, whnnce we experience that the body is much altered by force of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and by the alteration of the ſenſible appetite, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the ſpirits, the face and viſage is ſtraightway changed, ſo that by fear men are wont to become pale and wan; by anger and baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe red and bluſhing, and joy and ſorrow make their ſeverall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the countenance. The reaſon is, becauſe our underſtanding uſing corporall inſtruments and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, what ever paſſes in the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, eſpecially any vehement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, hath its influence into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and exteriour parts, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the face and eyes, for we plainly diſcern in proud men an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of look; in the cruel, a ſtern and fierce caſt of their eyes; in the light ones, a ſubtil and unconſtant deportment; and in the laſcivious, a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60687:134"/>wanton aſpect; nay, ſome malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous old women with the very conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of their looks are ſaid to infect and faſcinate little infants: to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the good and evill habits of the mind, eſpecially if they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken deep root, can ſcarce by any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation be ſo hidden, that they appear not in the exteriour. Every cauſe therefore likening its effect, and every effect making an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its cauſe, this exteriour beauty and comlineſſe of Chriſtians, and this honeſt and venerable manner of deportment cannot proceed from any other cauſe then the beauty of the mind and integrity of their life.</p>
                     <p>Which effect we daily ſee to be of ſuch virtue, that as we daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perionce there is nothing to be found more energeticall and efficacious for the converſion of ſinners, for we experience that the examples of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60687:135"/>ſimple Chriſtians living uprightly have profited men more then the perſwaſions of learned and eloquent Philoſophers, nay, even the relations or beholding of miracles. For we often ſee eloquent and learned men whilſt they are preaching high and elevated ſubtilties of knowledge to be hearkned unto with great attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but their lives not correſponding to their words, they have profited the Church very little, but onely born away the reports and praiſes of their eloquence and wiſdome. In paſt and preſent Ages there have been many miracles which little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the amendment of life; for though we ſee multitudes of men flock together to ſee them, yet if we look more diligently into it, we ſhall find that very few have reaped the profit of bettering their lives by them, but by the perfection of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Chriſtian, we both have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60687:135"/>known and ſeen innumerable ſorry and contrite for their ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto Almighty God, and thoſe not onely of the vulgar and ſimple ſort of people, but moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in prudence and learning; of the which very many having felt the odour of a good fame and ſanctity, contemning the pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the world, have betaken themſelves to theſe happy and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Societies and Monaſteries, where loathing their former courſes, they paſſe their lives with exceeding content, pleaſure, and ſincerity.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is manifeſt, that there is ſome virtue in Chriſtians by which theſe admirable effects are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for a body hath no ſubſtantiall influence into a ſpirit, which we ſee manifeſtly expreſſed in the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall body of all, to wit, the celeſtiall which ſuffer nothing from any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall virtue; for the heavens ſuffer
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60687:136"/>not from the neighbouring fire, much leſſe therefore ſhall a ſpirit ſuffer by any corporall influence. Thoſe things therefore that are exteriour and viſible in a Chriſtian life being corporall, they cannot have any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſubſtantiall influence into the ſoul, by which it may receive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, unleſſe thereby ſome virtue be together infuſed into it; but in a Catholique and virtuous man the moſt eminent and chief virtue, from which an upright inſtitution of life, exteriour beauty, and holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation doth proceed is the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Faith and Love of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for this Faith and Love being augmented, their exteriour orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and veneration are increaſed, and of greater efficacy for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of men. Faith therefore which operates with love cannot be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, ſeeing that falſity is void of all virtue, and cannot penetrate the heart of man.</p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:60687:136"/>
                     <p>Verity is more powerfull then falſity, but there was never any vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or remedy found more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the living well and virtuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then a Chriſtian life, as we are taught by the compariſon of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and other men, by whoſe learning and examples very few have been converted to a good life, and by the life of Chriſtians innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable do daily riſe and leade moſt unſpotted lives; and therefore a vain and erroneous falſity cannot be the ground or root of this life, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, men would more eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd to the amendment of their lives, by the learning and morality of Philoſophers, then by Chriſtian examples, which we find moſt falſe by experience.</p>
                     <p>Moreover Almighty God being the firſt mover without whom there is not the leaſt motion, and doing all things by his wiſdome, he ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60687:137"/>the nobler effects to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler cauſes; but the moſt excellent of all effects is a Chriſtian life: Almighty God therefore by exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and chiefly by internall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations ſtirring up men to this life by moſt conſpicuous examples of the faithfull, to the end that the cauſe may produce an effect like it ſelf, as the ſunne and men do generate a man, it follows neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily that a perfect Chriſtian is the nobleſt cauſe and moſt perfect inſtrument of producing this effect: Therefore the virtue of this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment co-operating with Almighty God is not a falſity, but a moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Verity; but this virtue is Faith inflamed with a burning cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as I have ſhown; our Faith therefore is moſt true.</p>

                     <p>VVE have proved now by the aſſiſtance of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God the Verity of Chriſtian Faith out of the manifeſt effects, which daily are ſeen in the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Church, and although there might be manifold other arguments brought to the confirmation of it, yet having regard to my intended brevity, I will argue onely out of thoſe events of former Ages, of the Verity of which the whole world is a ſufficient witneſſe. Wherefore, as Philoſophers by the effects which they ſaw in naturall things were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſearch into the cauſes of things, we in like manner ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the triumph of Chriſt,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60687:138"/>which we have heretofore deſcribed, will moſt exactly, as farre forth as the matter requires, ſearch into the cauſes of thoſe effects. And as the Philoſophers contemplating the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, out of the greatneſſe, the wonderfull order and perfection of the whole world, did conclude that the cauſe of it was Almighty God, who was more powerful, wiſe, and perfect then all others, whom they termed the firſt principle and mover of all things; ſo we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the triumph of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, will ſhew him to have been, and to be beyond all compariſon more powerfull then the feigned Gods of all other Religions, and to have done greater things, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced perfecter effects then any, and with an ineffable and infinite wiſdome and goodneſſe to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſſed them. Which done it will be clear that this God,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60687:138"/>is the great Lord and King above all other Gods.</p>
                     <p>I will begin with the effects of his Power, and placing his triumph before your eyes, I argue in this manner. Either this Jeſus the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Nazarean, whom the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians adore is true God, and firſt cauſe of all things, or he is not; if he be, the diſputation is ended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if he be God, the Chriſtians Faith, and his univerſall Doctrine and Religion muſt be true: if he be not, it follows, that Jeſus the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean was a moſt prodigious mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of a moſt inexcogitable pride, and unheard of arrogance, whilſt being a pure creature and mortall man, he would be eſteemed as the onely ſupreme Deity, and adored above all others: whence we might juſtly tearm him the moſt lying and worſt of all creatures, nay, even the moſt notorious of all fools, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60687:139"/>phane novelties ſet abroach, then may you ſee ſtraight-way the hedg cut in two, the old fathers bounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Catholick doctrine ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Churches faith torn in pieces. Such were they whom the Apoſtle ſharply reprehendeth in the 2. Epiſtle to the Cor. Chap. 11: <hi>For ſuch falſe Apoſtles</hi> (quoth he) <hi>are crafty workers transfiguring them ſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</hi> What is transfiguring them ſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, but this? The Apoſtles alleaged the examples of ſcripture &amp; they likewiſe cited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The Apoſtles cited the authority of the Pſalms, &amp; they likewiſe uſed it: The Apoſtles uſed the ſayings of the Prophets, and they in like manner brought them forth. But when that ſcripture which was alike alleadged, alike cited, alike brought forth, was not alike, &amp; in one ſenſe expounded, then were diſcerned the ſimple from the craftie, the ſincere from the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60687:139"/>counterfeit, the right and good from the froward and perverſe: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the true Apoſtles from thoſe falſe Apoſtates. And no marvel (ſaith S. Paul) <hi>For Sathan himſelf tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figureth himſelf into an Angel of light, it is no great matter therefore if his miniſters be transfigured as the miniſters of Juſtice.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever either falſe Apoſtles, or falſe Prophets, or falſe Doctours do bring forth the words of holy Scripture, by which they would according to their corrupt interpretation confirm their errour, there is no doubt, but that they follow the crafty ſlight of their maſter, which ſurely he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have invented, but that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very well, that there is no readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way to deceive the people, then where the bringing in of wicked er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is intended, that there the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the word of God ſhould
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60687:140"/>be pretended. But ſome will ſay, how prove you that the Devill uſeth to alledge the Scripture? Such as doubt thereof let them reade the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, where it is written: <hi>Then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill took him up</hi> (that is our Lord and Saviour) <hi>and ſet him upon the pinnacle of the Temple, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, If thou be the Sonne of God, caſt thy ſelf down, for it is written that he will give his Angels charge of thee, that they may keep thee in all thy wayes, in their hands ſhall they hold thee up, leſt perhaps thou knock thy foot againſt a ſtone. Mat.</hi> 4 How will he, think you, handle poor ſilly ſouls, which ſo ſetteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord of Majeſtie with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture? <hi>If thou be</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> (quoth he): we are diligently to weigh the doctrine of this place and to keep it in mind, that by ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an example of the Scripture,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60687:140"/>we make no ſcruple or doubt, when we ſee any alledge ſome place of the Apoſtles, or Prophets, againſt the Catholick Faith, but that by his mouth the Devil himſelf doth ſpeak. For as at that time, the head ſpake unto the head, ſo now the members do talk unto the members; that is, the members of the Devil to the members of Chriſt, the faithleſſe to the faithfull, the irreligious to the religious, to conclude, Hereticks to Catholicks. But what I pray, ſaith the Devil? <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God</hi> (quoth he) <hi>caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> That is to ſay: Deſireſt thou to be the Son of God, and to joy the inheritance of the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down,</hi> that is, Caſt thy ſelf down from this doctrine and tradition of this high and lofty Church, which is reputed to be the Temple of God. And if any one demand of theſe Hereticks, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them ſuch things; how
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60687:141"/>hath that crafty commander of the Arabians <hi>Mahomet</hi> done? he never affirmed himſelf God, true it is, by his eloquence and power, by his arms, gifts, and a luxurious licence of pleaſutes, he drew unto him a barbarous and unskilfull multitude; and did not he give a moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony of Chriſt? Aſſuming to himſelf nothing above humane forces and policy, but ſuch was not Jeſus the Nazarean; never did any mortall propoſe more difficult things to be believed and done then Chriſt did; for he abſolutely commanded the belief of a Trinity, to wit, the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt, the ſame one God three really diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed perſons, which yet being identified in ſubſtance, were one, and the ſelf ſame entity. Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands himſelf to be believed as God the Sonne, being the ſame with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60687:141"/>that he is at the ſame time true man, the ſonne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom he alſo commands to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the true Mother of God; that the Croſſe alſo, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eſteemed as the inſtrument of equivalent ignominy, ſhould be held in moſt ſupreme honour and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as the chief ſign of our ſalvation: In his laſt ſupper he commanded by his laſt Will and Teſtament, that we believe that Bread and Wine by virtue of a few words of Conſecration were really and ſubſtantially changed and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into his Body and Bloud, notwithſtanding, that the wonted accidents of Bread and Wine perſiſted, and that we ſhould under thoſe ſignes of Bread and Wine adore him, and receive him as nouriſhment and a celeſtiall <hi>via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum</hi> by which he promiſed us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and that no body could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60687:142"/>into the kingdome of Heaven unleſſe they were born again of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the holy Ghoſt. Moreover, he commanded that all his Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſhould be believed to a tittle without heſitation, doubt, or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, notwithſtanding they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things moſt difficult to humane underſtanding, without the belief of all which, there was no ſalvation. Nor is this conſtant and firm vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe things ſufficient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe contemning viſible things, and loving the inviſible, we do patiently undergo all kind of perſecutions, <hi>In patientia enim veſtra poſſidebitis (inquit) animas veſtras:</hi> In your patience you ſhall (ſaith he) poſſeſſe your ſouls. He promiſed his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and ſervants in this life, not riches, honours, and dignities, but the clean contrary, to wit, poverty, ignominy, oppreſſion, and what is more, outrages blows, baniſhment,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60687:142"/>gaols, conflicts, and torments, by ſuffering which for his ſake, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes us an unſpeakable beatitude; promiſing things unto us which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the underſtanding of man, as Glory, for example, in heaven with the Angels, the Reſurrection of the bodies, and <hi>that which neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath aſcended into the heart of man:</hi> Theſe things notwithſtanding being ſo, he brought to paſſe whatever he pleaſed, although the world fought againſt him. For innumerable men of all ſorts and conditions, have ſo received and maintained this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they choſe rather to leave their lives then to forſake their Faith. Kings alſo and Princes (as we ſee at preſent) humbly inclining themſelves under the yoke of Faith, are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his inferiour Miniſters. Let us ſet therefore before our eyes Chriſt as a poor man, accounted formerly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60687:143"/>and eſteemed the ſonne of a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and contemned by thoſe that knew him, and let us ask him what he thinks: Now let him anſwer, I, though a poor man and a ſtranger to the world, do intend to bring the whole world under my Laws, and do intend that men do adore me as a true God, together with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the holy Ghoſt, and that they alſo worſhip the Croſſe, on which being nail'd, I ſhall die a moſt ignominious and cruel death, between two theeves, and after this cruel death, that they do moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly and honourably reverence the Inſtruments and Reliques of my torments, and preſerve and place them amongſt their chief and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jewels and treaſures. And that above all things with Faith and their beſt Devotions they adore this Sacrifice of Bread and Wine, as the true ſubſtance of my Body and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60687:143"/>Bloud, and that by the Water of holy Baptiſme, they believe their ſouls to be cleanſed from all ſpot of ſinne and that they are ſanctified by the anointing of Oyl and Balm; and laſtly, that receiving and obſerving my whole Doctrine entirely, they eſteem it as a great wickedneſſe to derogate ought from it, even to the laſt tittle; and that they honour and make their addreſſes unto my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being ſanctified with an uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and perpetuall Virginity, and eſteem her next unto God, as Lady and Queen of the Univerſe, by a ſpeciall prerogative exalted above all the quire of Angels, and that they make their ſupplications to thoſe whieh from being Fiſhermen I have choſen to be my Diſciples, and that they adore their very bones, aſhes and other reliques: wouldſt thou not judge this poor man, thinking and ſpeaking ſuch
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60687:144"/>things of himſelf to be a ſot, fool, and worthy onely to be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at?</p>
                     <p>If further whilſt thou laugh'ſt at him, he ſhould go on, and ſay it is my will, that they not onely do moſt firmly beleeve all thoſe things, but that for this reaſon, they lead their lives moſt continently and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and for my promiſe given them of an inviſible happineſſe, they deſpiſe all terrene and ſenſible things, and to ſhew their moſt ardent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards me, they do moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly undergo poverty, thirſt, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, toils, miſeries, torments, and moſt cruel deaths, and that they chooſe rather all theſe things then deny the leaſt tittle of my Doctrine? Wouldſt thou not think this man wholly mad and out of his wits? If he ſhould adde to this, it is my pleaſure that all this be brought to paſſe againſt the reſiſtance of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60687:144"/>whole world, againſt Kings and Princes, againſt all the Religions and ſects of Gods and men; I intend to fight againſt infernal powers to gain the victory, and triumph over them, queſtionleſſe thou wouldſt burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a louder laughter.</p>
                     <p>But if being asked by what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or arms he meant to effect thoſe things? he ſhould anſwer, by no other then by the preaching of himſelf and his Diſciples; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe eloquence hath a great force to perſwade the minds of men (leſt any of his victories ſhould be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto it) that he ſhould affirm that faculty no way to fit his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that his Miniſters ſhould bring thoſe things to effect, without all art, by a ſober, modeſt and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple narration of thoſe things, thou wouldſt aſcribe this to a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of madneſſe. If he ſhould go on, I know that for my ſake an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60687:145"/>multitude of men would periſh; that the more there die, the more the number of the faithful ſhall increaſe, and my Faith ſhall be propagated to the fartheſt ends of the world; for the bloud of my Martyrs ſhall, as the Seed of the Church, yield a fruitfull harveſt of my Believers; and I will deliver unto one of thoſe my Fiſhermen, and to his Miniſters, which ſhall never fail, by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inheritance the perpetuall Sceptre of the Kingdome of Heaven, and I will make to ſtoop the ſupreme Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Lady of the world, and the Emperour himſelf to kiſſe the feet of my Subſtitutes. Oh! if thou ſhouldſt hear him ſay ſo, with what furies, I will not ſay madneſſe, wouldſt thou think him to be agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? what peals of laughter wouldſt thou not beſtow upon him?</p>
                     <p>Hearken to him a little further, there ſhall be infinite Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60687:145"/>of me, by moſt excellent and learned men, which ſhall praiſe and magnifie both me and my Doctrine, and extolling it above all others, ſhall defend it with their whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; my Prieſts ſhall with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the people, with ſolemne pomp and magnificence, and with torches lighted proclaim the ſame, which all the auditours ſhall receive uncovered with a reverend and moſt humble attention; would not theſe things ſeem dreams unto thee?</p>
                     <p>Hear him conclude, being armed with this onely weapon, without all doubt I will bring all thoſe things to perfection, and with an invincible power, I will prove my ſelf victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and will bring the whole world under my obedience, nor ſhall there ever any prevail againſt theſe ground-works and foundations of my Religion.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt he aſſevered theſe things
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60687:146"/>who would not judge that this were a work impoſſible to all mankind, to Nature and the heavens, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feizible to the divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe things being brought to effect, it is manifeſt that it is the onely work of the divine Majeſty, and that this Faith of Chriſt was onely eſtabliſhed by Almighty God alone: for was there ever any of the antient wizards, or Philoſophers, or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or ſome one of the moſt powerfull Kings that ever did the like? Or are there any Gods of the Gentiles and Nations to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this? Theſe kind of exploits have not been heard of from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen of things! let them bluſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and be confounded which judge of Chriſt as Infidels.</p>
                     <p>Nor may theſe things be ſaid to happen by chance, ſeeing that the Prophets and <hi>Sibylls</hi> foretold them
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60687:146"/>long before, and the antient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Monuments of the Jews and Gentiles give teſtimony of them, in which is written, that thoſe things were not onely revealed by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to come to paſſe, but that Almighty God did himſelf promiſe to perform them.</p>
                     <p>As in naturall things there are ſome cauſes neceſſary, and others, as of moſt things are indifferent, ſo in arguments and intellectuall diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſome there are which neceſſarily enforce the underſtanding to aſſent, which are called demonſtrations; others are called learned, dialecticall proofs, which though not alwayes, yet for the moſt part incline the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, though it do not firmly tye it to the aſſeriton; others again are ſo weak as they ſcarce incline it at all. Wherefore, although in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmall conſequence, as in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, there are found many
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60687:147"/>demonſtrations notwithſtanding in naturall things there are found very few, but in the high and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things, as alſo in moralls there are found no demonſtrations at all. But the light of our underſtanding is ſo weak, that it doth not diſcern the proper difference of things: for the Philoſophers uſe accidents inſtead of differences, and therefore they are ignorant of the proper definitions of things; the eſſence therefore or definition of the thing, being the mean or middle term of a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, it follows, that few or no demonſtrations are found in naturall things; wherefore, it is very hard to ſettle or ground our underſtanding in naturall and morall Sciences, much more in metaphyſicall, and moſt of all to apply our underſtandings, and altogether to attract our will, that we draw it from vices to virtues; for the ſenſuall part, being oppoſite
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60687:147"/>to the ſpirituall and rationall, it is very difficult that the affection fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the underſtanding, but of all things it is moſt difficult to make both Powers ſo agree, that the fruit of good works do iſſue from them, and perſevere unto the end of our lives; for of every Philoſopicall Theſis there are almoſt as many opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as heads, and very few of them effect what they teach, and ſcarce any of them have perſevered unto the end of their lives without corruption of vices, and if any one ſuch be found, they account it a miracle. Now if the very chief of thoſe Philoſophers could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the underſtanding of man to beleeve thoſe few truths which reaſon it ſelf dictates, and are naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in us, as that there is a God, and that he doth exerciſe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence about humane affairs; that good is to be ſought after, and evill
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60687:148"/>avoided, and others of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if they could not reconcile the affection in a very few things with the underſtanding for their well-doing, that they did not finally diſagree, by how much would they be leſſe able to perform it in things which exceed the bounds of reaſon: But the Diſciples of Chriſt with their onely preaching did unite the will and underſtanding of an infinite multitude of men, and, as it were, transfixing them, did enforce them to believe and love thoſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which neither demonſtration it ſelf, nor any humane reaſon could any way arrive, ſo that for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of heaven, they have eſteemed all earthly things as droſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming indefatigable in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they could not be removed from their purpoſes, neither by fair means, threats or torments. Now by what virtue have poor ignorant
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60687:148"/>Fiſhermen done theſe things? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by no Humane power, but Divine. For nature hath expreſſed the whole forces ſhe had towards mortalls in the Philoſophers, and yet we ſee, ſhe hath not had in them the force to accompliſh thoſe things. Certainly if the Faith of Chriſt were ſtuffed with lies, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe a few Fiſhermen could not have done thoſe wonders in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, nor could the Faith it ſelf have perſiſted in its full force ſo long time againſt ſo powerfull and manifold oppoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if Chriſt crucified and his Fiſhermen drew ſo efficaciouſly the whole world to the Divine love as I have ſaid, they could not do it by plain and bare words, for grave, wiſe, and learned men are not led away with bare words; wherefore it is certain that they confirmed their words with miracles, which were ſo
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60687:149"/>many, ſo ſtupendious, that farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the limits of nature, they could onely be wrought by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, who alone is the authour of miracles. But the Divine Majeſty doth not give teſtimony to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of lies, but of Faith, and therefore the Faith of Chriſt, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of which they are done, cannot be falſe. Now if any ſhould deny miracles, this would be the greateſt miracle of all, that thoſe manifold and admirable things, of which I have made mention ſhould be done without miracles by Chriſt a poor man, and thoſe ignorant and unpoliſhed Fiſhermen his Diſciples. Therefore, whether Chriſt and his diſciples did ſhine with miracles or no certainly an infinite power ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all the power of all Gods, doth appear in his works; but as of all cauſes that is the firſt which hath more power then the reſt, ſo amongſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60687:149"/>Gods, he is truly to be eſteemed the true God, which is moſt eminent above all others in power, as is Chriſt our moſt invincible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. XIIII.</hi> The ſame concluded out of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>I Will now ſhew that his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was inferiour to none. Firſt, then it is the part of Wiſdome to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpoſe things rightly, but in all things which are to be directed to their ends, the rule of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be drawn from the end of them; for then every thing is rightly diſpoſed when it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its proper end, for the end of every thing is its ſupreme and chief good; whence thoſe that in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of arts do ſo regard the end, that they direct all other ſubordinate
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60687:150"/>things unto it, are called maſters of that art. As in Architecture, thoſe work-men which carry the ſtones, wood, lime, and other requiſits are not ſaid to be architects, but thoſe which give the chief diſpoſition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and form to the building. In artificiall things, they having one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their particular ends, in which the end of man doth not conſiſt; he that ſhall be skilfull in thoſe is not to be term'd abſolutely wiſe, but with a reſtriction to his art. He therefore is rightly to be ſtyled abſolutely wiſe, who obſerving the ſupreme and conſummate end of humane life, doth diſpoſe all fit means and all his actions and operations unto it; But Jeſus the Nazarean efficaciouſly teaching his Diſciples and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhew'd them the true end of mans life, and the true means by which they were to arrive unto it, and this not onely by his Word, but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60687:150"/>by his lively example, ſo that no end of humane life can be found out, or imagined better, or more perfect then the life of Chriſtians. Wherefore it is clear that neither amongſt the Gods of the Gentiles (ſuppoſe the impoſſibility of their Deity) nor amongſt men there ever was or could be found a wiſer then Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſign of a knowing man is to be able to teach, for when a man is arrived unto the perfection of a Science he can eaſily teach it others, as in naturall things for example. When a man hath attained unto a perfect age, he is capable of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating mankind by generation of children: but there was not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God or man from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who taught a more profitable wiſdome then that of Chriſtians, or who taught it with greater facility: as for the learning of Philoſophers, it is obſcure, and ſcarce to be learned
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60687:151"/>in long time, and perplexed with many difficulties and errours, by reaſon of which the very maſters themſelves are very uncertain and anxious, as I have ſaid before that they were concerning the divine Providence, and in the end of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, but after the ſupreme wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our Saviour and Maſter Chriſt appeared, the world was ſo illuſtrated in a ſhort time with the Doctrine of the divine Providence and Goodneſſe, of the immortality of the ſoul, of the end and beatitude of man, of the means to arrive unto it, and many other documents that Chriſtians of both ſexes, even in their tender age and infancy did more clearly penetrate thoſe things, then famous Philoſophers had done by their great induſtry and ſtudy. And they became ſo conſtantly grounded in this Doctrine, that they had rather ſuffer a thouſand torments
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60687:151"/>even to death it ſelf, then impiouſly deny the leaſt tittle of the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The virtue of the cauſe appears the greater, the further it operates and the quicker; wherefore, the more quicker that Wiſdome hath its effect in men, the more queſtionleſſe is its power. 'Tis not the work of a principall virtue or induſtry to make thoſe wiſe which are docile, and have their minds greatly diſpoſed for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: but ſuddenly to teach fools, children dullards, girls, reprobates, and moſt wicked men, and ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets wiſdome, and convert them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a good life, exceeds all humane forces. But our Chriſt Jeſus did not onely convert innumerable of thoſe, but alſo of prudent and learned men preſently, with onely a beck, and made a change in their lives by the true compunction of their hearts, and daily doth not ceaſe from thoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60687:152"/>which none ever of the Gods or men have done; and therefore his Wiſdome and Doctrine is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all. When Nature is determined to do ſomething in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it is not to be eſteem'd the part of any rare virtue to effect it in naturall things by means which are naturall, as if a ſpirituall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the application of fire to a houſe ſhould ſtraight burn it, which was not hard for any man to do; but if it were performed by contrary cauſes as by ſtriking fire out of ice to raiſe a great combuſtion, this would be eſteemed a work of great virtue. It is a ſign therefore of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and infinite virtue to produce all naturall effects without any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtrument, or to do any thing with any inſtrument, or to do it with the inſtruments ordained for contrary effects. Wherefore, to teach wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by due and naturall means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60687:152"/>to the wonted capacity of men as the Philophers do, is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of admiration; but to teach us the ſupreme and ineffable wiſdome by the folly of the world, that is by thoſe things which men commonly eſteem fooliſh and abſurd, and to convert thoſe follies into the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of divine Wiſdome, and to place the chief Wiſdome in them is a moſt difficult work, and to be eſteemed onely Divine. For if the horrour and contumely of the Croſs, together with the ſcorns, buffets, ſtripes and torments, which Chriſt in his death did ſuffer, be rightly conſidered, there could be found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more fooliſh and horrible then the Croſſe, before Chriſt was nailed unto it; but Chriſt by means of it did infuſe into the wood, the moſt ſovereign of all Wiſdomes, as all Chriſtians do profeſſe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie by daily experience; therefore
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60687:153"/>the ſupreme and divine Wiſdome hath been onely found in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, Wiſdome being the honour and badge of Divine things, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Wiſdome is to be preferred before all others, which teaches men Divine things better then all others: but this hath been done by none ſo well as by that of Chriſt; therefore this muſt be the moſt excellent of all. But that it is ſo appears out of the Writings before Chriſt, which are not contained in his Doctrine, which if they be compared with the Books and Monuments of Chriſtians, thou wilt eaſily confeſſe that there were very few things taught by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophers and other Authours. Nay, what is more, Chriſtian Doctrine doth extremely conduce to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and perfection of Philoſophy it ſelf, ſeeing it doth ſo wonderfully every way lay open the knowledge
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60687:153"/>of Divine things, that almoſt all Chriſtians do profeſſe, know and teach thoſe things which before them were ſcarce underſtood by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themſelves. And after the preaching of the Apoſtles men did ſo bluſh at their own errours, and ſtrive to purge themſelves of them, in ſuch ſort, as if having wandred in a dark night and weltred in the dirt of their errours, being environed on a ſudden with a great light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their impurities and ſtricken with ſhame and confuſion they had endeavoured to cleanſe themſelves; for both the Philoſophers and Poets being confounded at the worſhip of their Idols, at their old wives ſtories, and impure dotage, the light of Chriſt once ſhining (at whoſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant luſtre they were dazled) they endeavoured to make good one lie with another, to feign their Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall Interpretations, when they ſaw
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60687:154"/>they could by no other means hide and juſtifie the wickedneſſe of their Gods, and their vices ſo enormious that the worſt of men would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own them.</p>
                     <p>It belongs alſo to a wiſe man not onely to have the knowledge of eaſie things, but of thoſe which are moſt difficult, and to be able to teach the ſame, and defend them againſt their adverſaries; no man ever taught more difficulties of Divine things, nor ever made them appear with more eaſe then Chriſt, who did not onely inſtruct his own few Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but even the whole world. And Chriſtians do eaſily defend thoſe documents againſt infinite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, that whoever ſhall have read their Arguments and Books they will not be able to doubt, that the verity of them proceeded of an eternall and incomparable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Our adverſaries fought
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60687:154"/>againſt them moſt exactly, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Sophiſtry, with captious and ſyllogiſticall contentions, but with contumely, threats, the ſword and death it ſelf, over all which their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Verity remained triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. Truly, if the Tyrants had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Princes of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers with both arguments and torments, as they did againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, I am confident they would have been contented to deny their very firſt Principles; but Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thoſe things which cannot be found out by naturall reaſon, and defending them both from the ſword and from all the wiſdome and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gods and Philoſophers both by his ſolid force eſtabliſhed them for all eternity.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Chriſtians Faith is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or fictitious; if true, we are agreed; if fictitious, even thence may be drawn an efficacious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60687:155"/>That Chriſt was the moſt underſtanding and wiſe of all others which found out ſuch difficult and ſublime things, and did ſo perſwade them unto mortalls, that they would not be infringed or deſtroyed by any device or humane reaſon or power. That Chriſtian Doctours themſelves do make profeſſion of the ſcience of Philoſophy, and although thoſe things which Chriſt taught were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſphere of reaſon, yet they ſhew that they are no way repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant unto Philoſophy; and that other Sciences do rather ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them then otherwiſe. They do not as certain ſuperſtitious and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, who reject or contemn Philoſophy, or ſome other true Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, challenging all things which are well ſaid as their own, from others whom they ſay are unjuſt poſſeſſours of them. Now who is there to be found wiſe, cautious, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60687:155"/>ſubtill which can maintain any ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and lie againſt all the arguments and reaſons of ſo many wiſe and learned men, and ſhew that they are conſonant to all Philoſophy? Truth certainly is conſonant to truth, and all truth is diſſonant to falſity. If therefore the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers not without great difficulty have been able to preſerve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect Verity inviolate againſt their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, by how much leſſe will they be able to defend falſity being of its own proper nature weak, againſt violent and ſubtill oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? therefore although it were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this Faith were fictitious, yet we ſhould neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Chriſt had the moſt pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and elevated wiſdome of all others, who by his invitation hath drawn men unto him by moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and uninveſtigable documents, and hath enforced them by a ſacred
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60687:156"/>inſpiration to leade virtuous and bleſſed lives. But ſeeing that things inconſiſtent cannot hang together, as for example, a falſe and true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher can have no true coherence; and that by his Doctrine men are directed as by a ſtraight rule to a virtuous life, we muſt confeſſe that his Faith and Doctrine is true, and that he is the wiſeſt of all Gods and men.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that men moſt verſed and skilfull in all Sciences, and moſt eminent for the ſanctity of their lives have embraced that Doctrine of Chriſt as the ſupreme Wiſdome, and have extol'd it with their praiſes, magnified it with their Works and Monuments, and confirmed it with the teſtimony of their lives. Which had they not moſt certainly known that it was delivered unto men by Almighty God, certainly they had not undergone ſo many labours toils
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60687:156"/>amd agonies for the defence of it.</p>
                     <p>The Wiſdome of the greateſt Maſter then chiefly appears, when by a compendious epitome he brings his Diſciples to the end and laſt perfection of all Sciences, but this Chriſt alone hath effected; for every Science is either rationall or reall, as for rationall, it is either Logick, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, or Poetry, which treats of <hi>ens rationis,</hi> or the entity of reaſon: and their end is by divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Exhortations to force the underſtanding of man to aſſent to that which they incend. To this Chriſt himſelf hath above all other without all difficulty brought his Diſciples; which moſt appears out of this, that whereas they were Fiſhermen formerly ignorant and unskilfull, and innumerable others of the ſimpler ſort, who having once received this Doctrine have with moſt efficacious perſuaſions chang'd,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60687:157"/>as it were, the face of the whole world, which neither the force of arms, nor other endeavours of all Wiſdome (if we conſider it aright) could ever have done. As for reall Science it is divided into practicall and ſpeculative; the practicall is that which is morall, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Diſcipline doth teach ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſuch facility and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the Philoſophers (as I have ſaid before) can find no defect in it. If the Science be ſpeculative, it either abſtracts from all ſenſible and intelligible matter, and ſo it is that which is termed Divine, in the which Chriſt did ſo ſurpaſſe all others, that he is not onely the chief, but that there is no compariſon to be made with him: or it abſtracts onely from ſenſible matter and not from intelligible, and this is called Mathematick, by which one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the form, and hath no regard
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60687:157"/>to the good or end of it, (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſay): and for this reaſon, the Doctrine of Chriſt onely attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good and end of things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts little to this Science, becauſe it doth not appertain or conduce to ſalvation; yet if there be any profit to be gathered out of it which helps to a good and virtuous life, this the Chriſtian Doctrine laies claim unto; for in holy Scriptures there are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and figures, which are moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed and ordered for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving morality, and the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Divine perfections, ſo that neither in the leaſt Diſciplines of Philoſophy hath not this Doctrine its wholeſome and profitable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or the Science abſtracts from neither ſenſible nor intelligible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and this is naturall Philoſophy, to whoſe greateſt good and laſt end Chriſtian Doctrine doth by divers means both eaſily and with great
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60687:158"/>content and pleaſure lead us. For the knowledge of naturall things in it ſelf, is not that ſupreme end un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we ſtrive by them to attain unto, but by theſe corporall things we are brought unto the knowledge of inviſible objects, which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine doth afford with great ſatisfaction in great abundance, whilſt it repreſents moſt admirably, and to our great ſatisfaction the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible perfections and myſteries of Almighty God, in all naturall things as in ſo many mi rours; Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the moſt wiſe Maſter of all, who moſt eaſily brought the whole world to the laſt end and higheſt perfection of all Sciences.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the delights of the underſtanding farre exceed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the ſenſes, and that which chiefly appertains unto the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conſiſts in the knowledge of the firſt Verity, from which, as
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60687:158"/>it is moſt perfectly conceived, ariſes the greateſt delight. The ſign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the ſovereign Wiſdome of Chriſt is the ſupreme delight which Chriſtians enjoy in his contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then which there hath been none hitherto found ſo great: for there have been innumerable, as now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes there are, which for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the firſt Verity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Chriſtian Doctrine, forſaking all the pleaſures and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of the world have beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themſelves to deſert and ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred places, and which is moſt of all, they have made ſuch progreſſe in that contemplation, that a man would think they were not men, but petty Gods and Angels upon earth; for being as it were, elevated above the terrene ſphere of carnality they do not onely not affect it, but do not ſo much as vouchſafe to look upon it, having withing themſelves like
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60687:159"/>Gods and Angels that which ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and ſuffices them. Out of all which we may eaſily gather, that the Doctrine of Chriſt is the chief of all, and that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is the true Wiſdome of the eternall Father, which onely was able to bring ſo many and ſo wonderfull things to paſſe.</p>

                     <p>I Have now ſhown that Jeſus the Nazarean hath ſo farre ſurpaſſed all other men, and all the Gods of the Gentiles in Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that if any believe there is a God, he muſt queſtionleſſe judge no other beſide him to be ſo. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that I make the ſame appear out of his Perfection and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by proving that he is the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60687:159"/>of all Goods and the laſt end of humane life, in which we muſt in the firſt place obſerve, that humane actions are directed to ſome end or other; for the actions of men as they are humane proceed queſtionleſſe from the free will or election of man, by which he differs from brutes. Now the object of the will is ſome good or end prefixt, and therefore there being no infinite or endleſſe proceſſe of thoſe prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ends (otherwiſe the motion of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appetite would ceaſe) it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary there be one laſt end of man, for it is impoſſible there ſhould be two ſubſtantiall laſt ends of any thing, ſeeing that beyond the laſt end there remains nothing to be ſought after. That is called the laſt end which doth ſo ſatiate the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of any thing that it formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, or at leaſt ſubordinates all thoſe things which can be deſired or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60687:160"/>ſought after, and therefore there is but one and the ſame laſt end of all men. Nevertheleſſe we muſt know that all men do not agree about their laſt end, as it is taken materially, that is, where and in what it is found; although all agree in the formall conceit of it, that is, in the nature of it, and in what it conſiſts, becauſe the nature of the laſt end of mankind is the ſupreme felicity of it. Now all men agree in the deſire of their chief felicity, yet all do not think that that felicity conſiſts in the ſame thing. Having formerly proved that the laſt end of humane life is the firſt Verity and firſt cauſe, that is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, if I ſhall now ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt is this laſt end, it will manifeſtly appear that he is the firſt Verity, the firſt Cauſe, and true God, and the ſupreme good in which moſt aſſuredly doth conſiſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the laſt end.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:60687:160"/>
                     <p>Which that we may more clearly underſtand, we muſt conſider, that when any nature is directed; or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards any thing as to its laſt end, that by the admixtion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature which diſtracts it, it may be ſo hindred, that it do not proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute its end at all, or at leaſt but very remiſly; for example, a weight or ponderous body naturally tends downwards; and all gravity, or ſuch bodies inclin'd by the form of their weight, or of their nature ſeek their centre; but a bird flies upwards, becauſe it hath not onely the form of gravity but alſo that of an animall or ſenſible living creature, and ſo this animall or living motion ſuſpends, and hindring the naturall inclination of its gravity or weight, it mounts on high. In like manner, an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mixt body having much air and fire mixt with its earth ſinks downward but ſlowly, but if there
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60687:161"/>be any weight which is meerly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, it is vehemently carried downwards, unleſſe ſome violent obſtacle do hinder it; and the more purely ponderous it is, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly it is carried of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to its centre: wherefore man conſiſting of a double nature, to wit, ſpirituall and corporall or ſenſible, although the underſtanding and will by their naturall motion tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Almighty God; yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the mixture of the ſenſible part, which for its naturall functions hath its ſenſible organs, it is diſturb'd with paſſions, and is more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtracted then otherwiſe it would naturally be; ſo that although the ſuperiour and ſpirituall part cannot be violently forced; yet either by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the underſtanding being ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or by exceſſe of appetite the will, becoming ill affected, it is drawn to affect thoſe things which
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60687:161"/>are very inordinate. Wherefore, if we intend to find out that in which the nature of the laſt end of man doth conſiſt, it is neceſſary to ſeek it out of its motion, out of the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of its love and ardent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but our nature conſiſting of both the rationall and ſenſible part, we muſt not conſider the affections of them, who lead their lives like beaſts, but of thoſe onely which have reaſon alwayes for the guide of their actions which are onely worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the true name of men: for if by the experiment of a ponderous body I intend to find out the centre of gravity, I muſt not conſider it in the flight of birds, but by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bodies which are meerly ponderous; but I have formerly proved, that there is no life more purely rationall, then that of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, therefore we ſhall come bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the knowledge of the laſt end
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60687:162"/>of man, by the conſideration of the love and affection of Chriſtians, which truly and with all propriety are to be eſteemed men, rather then by the inordinate appetites of others. But all Chriſtians which live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, with a moſt vehement affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with a ſweet concord and harmony, do bend their whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours towards Chriſt crucified as towards their ſupreme and laſt end, for whoſe ſake they eſteem all other things as dregs and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore he is their laſt end, the true God, and ſupreme good of all mankind.</p>
                     <p>The laſt end of man is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and abſolute perfection, and therefore the nearer he is unto it, the more perfect he is, and the more he increaſes in perfection at the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtance he is from it, becauſe to grow perfect is nothing elſe then to approach unto his laſt end; but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60687:162"/>there hath never any thing been found by coming near unto which by the approaches of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affection (we ſpeak of them here and not of corporal approaches) humane nature hath ſo much profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as unto Chriſt crucified, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the more nigh it comes unto him, the more vehemently it affects him, and the more it becomes (as I have formerly ſhown) perfect in all morality; whence it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Chriſt is the laſt end of humane life. The deſire of the laſt end is moſt naturall unto all thins, and therefore every thing immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably adheres unto its laſt end; for the laſt end in practicall things is like the firſt principles in things of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore as the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ingrafted in our nature, ſo is the deſire of our laſt end, and therefore it perſiſts immoveable. Therefore when a man no way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60687:163"/>by his vicious appetites, doth rationally ſo firmly fix his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon ſome one thing ſo tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that he diſeſteems all others for it, and had rather loſe his life then forſake it, it is a ſign that he hath truly found out his laſt end; and hence it is, that although others have prefixed unto themſelves other laſt ends, yet we have ſeen none, or very few, except Chriſtians, who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe their lives then forſake thoſe ends of theirs; others undergo the extremity of all miſeries to conſerve their lives; for a man will give all he hath rather then loſe his life: but Chriſtians do not onely patiently, willingly and joyfully loſe all they have for Chriſt, but even they eſteem their lives as nothing for his ſake; and certainly if Chriſt were not the ſupreme Good, ſuch men of the greateſt wiſdome would not loſe their lives, being the moſt precious
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60687:163"/>unto them, for the defence of the greateſt of all errours.</p>
                     <p>Moreover things which are of the ſame nature being ordained for the ſame end, and in that regard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united, even as all ponderous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are in &amp; tending to their centre, it is a moſt manifeſt argument ſeeing that there was nothing ever found in which men were ſo firmly united as in Chriſt crucified, that he is the laſt end of man; for thoſe that believe in him are no leſſe united and linked together, then all the parts of the earth being compacted into one ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid globe are adherent to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: in the ſame manner all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which truly ſeek Chriſt, come to have but one heart and one ſoul in him, nay, the more they profit in their Faith, with greater delight and more ardent charity do they love one another: if therefore Chriſt were onely a man, and his Faith
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60687:164"/>contain a clandeſtine and impious fiction and forgery, it would not have taken ſuch effect in ſo many thouſands of men of ſeverall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and qualities; becauſe thoſe who are onely tyed together by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity are eaſily diſſolved, nor could ſo many men grounding the union of their friendſhip on the falſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an errour, increaſe their love as the errour grew more enormious: ſpirituall delights they are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when our ſoul approaches nearer to its laſt end, and then they are moſt perfect when they more attain unto the end it ſelf. If man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſomewhat delighted when he beholds his end imperfectly afar off, he will be farre more when he ſhall more perfectly poſſeſſe it; but the delight which Chriſtians do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy of Chriſt, ſurpaſſeth all the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour pleaſures of the ſenſes or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; which appears out of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60687:164"/>three things: firſt, out of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable conſtancy of Martyrs, of whom we reade innumerable, who with joy and mirth ran to their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as to their nuptials, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the midſt of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have ſung hymns unto God, as if they had been in ſome place of pleaſure: which could no way hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; unleſſe by the exceſſe of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe delight, as if all their corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſes were brought afleep, and Chriſt had defended them from all grief and terrour, which truly is a prerogative not granted to any other delight: for a grief (as experience teaches) diſturbs the whole man, and expelling all pleaſure puts him out of himſelf. Secondly, out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite examples of the antient Monks, who, forſaking the world and wandring in the deſerts and caves as the companions of wild beaſts, in abſtinence, faſting, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60687:165"/>mortification, being in want of all things, and naked, have neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe lived moſt joyfully with that unſpeakable content which they found in the contemplation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things. And as yet we ſee the imitation and prints of their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps in the Religious men, who in great numbers (as I have ſaid) of their own accords ſubjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a willing ſervitude and to perpetuall clauſures, do moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly and joyfully paſſe their lives under a moſt exact obedience, as if they were ſet at liberty by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjected under this yoke of Grace. Thirdly, out of the lives of moſt wiſe men, who flouriſhing with the erudition of all Sciences, having drunk of the ſacred fountain of holy Scriptures, and taſted the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, have given over all other Sciences, being onely delighted with his Doctrine, unto
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60687:165"/>which they have ſtuck ſo firmly, as if they could not be drawn from it, eſteeming all the wiſdome of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and eloquence of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours as dry apples and unſavoury, which I can teſtifie of very many, ſuch as I have known to have done ſo; but of theſe examples it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the delights which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of the Faith &amp; Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt crucified do far ſurpaſs all others: we muſt therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they proceed from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and ſupreme good, and chiefly becauſe the more near acceſs we have unto Chriſt by Faith and Love, the more are thoſe delights augmented.</p>
                     <p>And that we may briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with one argument, joyning in one all the proprieties of the laſt end; all the individuall or ſingular natures of the ſame kind (as I have ſaid) are ordained for the ſame laſt end, and all men do agree in the nature of their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60687:166"/>laſt end, though not in the thing in which that nature of the laſt end is contained, for this is that which we ſeek. The bliſſe therefore of man conſiſting in an act of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we muſt conclude, that that thing to which the nature of the laſt end agrees, is that in which all the moſt rationall and which are moſt pure of heart do agree in, and with all uniformity ſeek after it, and do immoveably inſiſt upon, and which they love above themſelves, and conſequently are moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly delighted in it, and deriving from it the integrity of their lives, and the ſplendour of a celeſtiall cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and transformed with a Divine love, become even one and the ſame thing with it, and being in a manner raiſed above the world, valuing all terrene things as dirt, they take joy onely in thoſe Divine favours, and laſtly enjoy a moſt bleſſed quiet
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60687:166"/>and peace of mind. But theſe things which are the conditions of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good were never found in any but in Chriſt crucified, and tha as he is true God, and therefore he is the ſupreme Good.</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould I inſiſt longer in theſe things which are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves manifeſt? For Good of its own nature deſiring to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelf, the ſupreme Good muſt needs be that which moſt deſires to communicate its virtue; but there is no communication of any other good found ſo great and ample as that which proceeds from Chriſt Jeſus, after whoſe coming into the world and the propagation of his Faith, the whole world is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of a dark and profound miſt of ſinnes and errours, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all virtue and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of life, and ſo many graces
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60687:167"/>and favours are from thence granted and decreed unto the faithfull, that they are rightly eſteemed happy and bleſſed upon earth; for if there can be any felicity or bliſſe upon earth, it is onely found in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which I have proved in the Epitome of the ſimplicity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life.</p>
                     <p>The incomparable Clemency and Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt declares the infinite abundance of his Goodneſſe; becauſe no malice of any hainous ſinners and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe are ſufficient to make him deny or deferre his pardon to thoſe that are truly repentant, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he doth not ceaſe to heap greater graces and gifts on thoſe who return unto him. And it is a thing moſt experienced, that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as any ſhall by ſinne forſake him, that he is ſtraight deprived of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60687:167"/>that ſweetneſſe and righteouſneſſe of life, ſo that he is drowned in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene impurities and corruptions, and that he is tormented and vexed with intolerable cares; but aſſoon as he returns to his former ſtate of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quiet, he is, as it were, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the unquenchable thirſt of ſome moſt malignant calenture.</p>

For if he be not God, I know no other who may any way ſeem to be ſo; for if Almighty God do govern and conſerve theſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things by congruous means, we having proved that there is no means more perfect for a good and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life then Chriſt, I do not ſee how we may chuſe, but either we muſt confeſſe that Chriſt is the true means of our bliſſe warranted by Almighty God unto mankind, or that we deny the divine Providence and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60687:168"/>Juſtice; or that denying there is any God at all, we believe that all things happen by chance or fate: all which, beſides the firſt which muſt neceſſarily be granted, are moſt abſurd and fooliſh.</p>
                     <p>If there be any true Religion in the world, which by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have convinced and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as granted, who can deny, conſidering ſo many, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Reaſons, that this muſt needs be the Chriſtian Religion? There being no other ſo well grounded in Reaſon; ſo that if this be not true, it will force us to deny all Religion.</p>
                     <p>Alſo we know that no other Religion was ever ſo ſharply impugn'd perpetually in all Ages, as the Chriſtian; for other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, or rather fraudulent Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, in a manner by the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60687:169"/>ſame vanity by which they were ſet afoot, were deſtroyed and came to nothing; but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as the moſt pure gold, hath been refined in perpetuall flames of moſt cruel Perſecutions, which could not have happened, had any other been true, and this falſe.</p>
                     <p>It is moreover manifeſt, that the Chriſtian Religion never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered or was perſecuted by virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and juſt men, but was alwayes held by them in great eſteem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and veneration, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had continuall and inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Warre, with flagitious, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſacrilegious Tyrants, and their father the Devil; and as many as have perſecuted it and its Miniſters, have alwayes been (as now-adayes alſo appears) of a moſt wicked condition, which never happened to any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60687:169"/>why therefore ſhould we chuſe to imitate wicked men, rather then the virtuous?</p>
                     <p>Further, there is no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, unto which ſo many have hitherto been converted, and do daily come unto it upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they know themſelves not to be called to riches, honours or pleaſures, (which in their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme they oblige themſelves to renounce) but unto contempt, abſtinence, parſimony, contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and (if occaſion require it) unto the greateſt and laſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all; no man therefore being in his right wits would be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto it by ſuch promiſes and obligations, as we have ſeen ſo many thouſands to be, unleſſe the light of a moſt evident Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did even pierce the hearts of mortalls.</p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60687:170"/>
                     <p>The underſtanding therefore is conſtrained by theſe reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to believe this admirable Faith of Chriſt to be true; for if one, two or three, or a few agru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not force an aſſent, yet all together if they be rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, will not have leſſe force then Mathematicall Demonſtrations, or then if ſome of the dead were raiſed to life for the confirmation of this Verity.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if the Chriſtian Religion be true, all others are to be exploded as falſe; ſeeing the Chriſtian doth moſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avouch, that there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of it; which is no more then reaſon; becauſe our ſalvation conſiſting in the viſion of God, unto which no man can attain without Celeſtiall and Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, (as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60687:170"/>no man can obtain it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, the Scripture affirming, <hi>Sine Fide impoſſibile eſt placere Deo,</hi> That without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
                     <p>Nor is there left any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of a juſt complaint or excuſe for thoſe who are born in ſtrange and remote Countreys, which do not admit the Chriſtian Religion; becauſe if any one led by the light of reaſon, with a right intention and pure heart, do convert himſelf to the univerſall and common Parent of all men, and their Creatour, who appears plainly in the order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Creatures, and which affords unto all the things which are neceſſary for them, and ſhall beſeech him to ſhew his Verity unto him; he ſhall not (as I have touched in the beginning of this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60687:171"/>Work according to the Chriſtian Truth) be fruſtrate of his deſire; but ſhall obtain the Light which is neceſſary to his ſalvation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by internall inſpirations, as did holy <hi>Job;</hi> or by Angels, as did <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> the Centurion; or as the Eunuch by <hi>Philip,</hi> that is, by ſome A poſtolicall man.</p>

Now in all humane Actions there is a certain order obſervable, by which one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſubordinate and directed, as it were, unto another; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60687:174"/>in the building of an houſe, wee provide ſtones in order to reare the walls, the walls we intend for the houſe-ſake, the houſe for our dwelling: But in things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that which firſt exciteth the mind of the Agent, and moves him to work is the end, or ayme which he deſireth to compaſs by duemeans; if therefore there were not ſome <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate or laſt end,</hi> beyond which nothing elſe could be intended or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, the appetite of man would never be fixed, but perpetually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring this thing for that things ſake, and that thing again for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo <hi>in infinitum:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it would alſo follow, that there could be no Terme or period of his Action, which were abſurd.

                     <p>
                        <hi>MAns happineſs conſiſteth not in any outward goods.</hi> By <hi>outward goods,</hi> we underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Riches, Honours Dignities, Power, &amp;c. in which we ſay <hi>The happineſs of man conſiſteth not.</hi> For proof whereof I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an infinite number of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the Thing it ſelf being ſo clear as it is, and acknowledged by all, I ſhall inſiſt onely upon ſome few. My firſt reaſon is, becauſe happineſs is the ſupream or chief good of man, which admitteth not the leaſt mixture or participation of evill, no more then the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat doth any degree of cold: Bleſſedneſs therefore cannot conſiſt in the fruition of <hi>ſuch goods,</hi> which (as continuall experience tells us) do admit variety of evils, not of fortune only or chance, but (which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60687:176"/>is worſt of all,) <hi>the evils of ſin:</hi> for ſo we ſee, very wicked men have their ſhare <hi>in theſe goods.</hi> Secondly, becauſe Bleſſedneſs is a <hi>Self-ſuffice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,</hi> ſuch as once being had, no other content can be wanting; but we ſee, though a man be never ſo well provided of <hi>theſe goods,</hi> yet 'tis poſſible he may be ſtill in want of others no leſs neceſſary; as a rich man is not alwayes wiſe, nor a man of Honour healthfull. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Bleſſedneſs is ſuch a perfect good Thing, that from it no evill can proceed, which is not true of Riches, Honours, Power, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by occaſion of them, through the envy indeed and malice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers many miſchiefs do ariſe, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Parricides, Treaſons, &amp; what not? Fourthly, becauſe the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which diſpoſe a man unto True happineſs are intrinſecall or from within him, it being the end
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60687:177"/>whereunto he is naturally ordained and fitted; But unto <hi>the goods</hi> wee ſpeak of, Riches, Honours, &amp;c. a man is rather diſpoſed by cauſes extrinſecall and from without him, yea many times, by meere chance, and therefore they are called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Goods of Fortune: it is clear therefore, that in them Felicity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That mans happineſſe conſiſteth not in the goods of the Body.</hi> By <hi>goods of the body,</hi> we mean the life of man, Health, Beauty, Youth, Strength, Courage, and the like, in all or in any of which, it is manifeſt, true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe cannot conſiſt. Becauſe firſt, this body is not made for it ſelf, but for the ſoule; as the matter is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for the forme, and not the forme for the matter. Therefore it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60687:177"/>is, that all <hi>goods</hi> belonging to the body, are ordained indeed for the ſoule as unto the proper end for which they are made. Beſides, ſhould the happineſſe of man be placed in ſuch <hi>goods</hi> as thoſe, this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity would follow, namely that many even Bruit Beaſts ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of happineſſe more then man; for certainly as to the fruition of ſuch bodily goods, there be many beaſts which do far excell man: as for example, in length of life the Elephant, in ſtrength and courage the Lyon, the Stag in ſwiftneſs, the Eagle in ſharp ſightedneſs, and in perfection and ſoundneſſe of health almoſt all of them; for experience tels us, what a number of helps and how much art is requiſite to ſupport this fraile carcaſe of ours, more then of any other kind of creatures; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'its impoſſible true felicity ſhould be found in <hi>it.</hi>

And ſo againe (as was touched in the precedent Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Beaſts alſo would be found ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of happineſs, as well as men, yea rather of a more perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then man: for as much as they

Now all things, beſide God, appear unto us, and in truth are, but <hi>effects</hi> of ſome other cauſe; and therefore, whatſoever a man knows beſide God, he knows it either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly or imperfectly: if imperfectly, his deſire is never ſatisfied, untill he

Seeing therefore, as we ſaid, that man obſerving the effect, doth naturally deſire to know the cauſe; it is manifeſt, that this appetite of his cannot be compleatly ſatisfied with the knowledge even of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things that be, but ſtill it will be endeavouring and deſiring to ſee

In the ſole knowledge therefore and fruition of God (who is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall and firſt cauſe of all Things) doth mans Bleſſedneſſe conſiſt: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well obſerved, <hi>Thou haſt made us O Lord</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>for thy ſelf, and our heart is reſtleſſe and unquiet, untill it findeth its repoſe in Thee.</hi>

'Tis true, in a generall notion all men do naturally deſire to be happy (becauſe 'tis naturall for every thing to deſire at leaſt that perfection which is proper to his kind,) yet in particular, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their indeavours or motions to attain happineſſe, they do as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally miſtake, few of them know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where to find it, or in what Thing it conſiſts: and therefore we ſee their deſires thereof are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unequall, irregular, and reſtleſſe.

                        <hi>That Chriſtians have this Felicity Inchoate in a greater meaſure, then the beſt of Philoſophers.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the Contemplation and Fruition of God, which good Chriſtians have, are in themſelves greater and more perfect, then thoſe which the moſt excellent Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers could ever arrive unto. By what I have elſewhere ſaid, it is manifeſt, that a Chriſtians life is not founded upon any naturall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple either within or without man, but in ſomething ſupernaturall, that is to ſay, in the Grace of God, by which alſo he is elevated unto a participation of the Divine nature. Seeing therefore that the operation of every thing followeth its Eſſence, (for every thing worketh, ſo far as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60687:185"/>it can, agreeably to its own nature) by how much the nature or eſſence of any thing is more perfect, by ſo much perfecter alſo is it in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or working: But Grace is a thing of a much nobler and more perfect eſſence then nature; and therefore the operations or effects w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> proceed from thence, muſt needs excell thoſe of nature. And ſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that by how much the operation or Action of any Thing is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by ſo much a greater and more perfect delight is conceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, it muſt needs follow, that thoſe ſpirituall Contentments and Guſts which good Chriſtians have with God, and in God, do infinitely excel thoſe of philoſophers, which at beſt are but naturall, and ſuch as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is from whence they proceed. Beſides, ſeeing that happineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſterh in the Contemplation of God, the greater knowledge a man hath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60687:186"/>of God, the greater, that is, the more perfect is his Contemplation and Fruition of him: But this is certain that Chriſtians have greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, then philoſophers; as well in regard of the light of Grace, which perfects that of nature, and reveals unto Chriſtians many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent myſteries altogether unknown to philoſophers; as alſo in regard of that Purity of heart, which, as we have ſhewed elſwhere, true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do injoy in a more excellent meaſure then others: The delights therefore which Chriſtians injoy in their Contemplation of God are much greater in themſelves and more perfect, then thoſe which the beſt of philoſophers could have. And ſeeing that this <hi>happineſſe Inchoate,</hi> which we ſpeak of, doth conſiſt in that Contemplation and Fruition of God which is attainable in this life, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it is more perfectly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Laſtly, this <hi>happineſſe Incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> is ſo much greater and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by how much it cometh nearer to Felicity conſummate, or that of the next life: But the Felicity of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is here begun, cometh much nearer to Felicity Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, then that of philoſophers; for as much as no man ſhall ever actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attain heaven but by Grace, (which the philoſophers neither had nor knew;) it is manifeſt therefore, that true Chriſtians are more juſtly eſteemed happy in this world, then philoſophers: and if then they, much more then any other ſort of men.</p>

We are therefore in the firſt place to obſerve, that the Good
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60687:187"/>which delighteth us, the perfecter it is in it ſelf, the greater delight it cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: now 'tis certain, that Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall natures are much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then things ſenſitive; and that the firſt verity is infinitely more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then all the reſt: it is therefore moſt able and fit to cauſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delectations. We are to obſerve in the ſecond place, that the faculty likewiſe, by how much <hi>it</hi> is more exquiſite and perfect, ſo much the greater delectation is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived in the work thereof: for the quality of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light follows immediately that of operation; therefore the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect operation is, the perfecter is the delight; but as we ſaid, the perfecter the faculty be, the perfecter is alſo the operation: now of the ſame facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is to be accounted the more perfect operation, which doth more perfectly comprehend and reach its object. Seeing therefore the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60687:188"/>is a more exquiſite faculty then ſenſe, the operation therof muſt needs be more perfect then that of ſenſe, and conſequently a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light muſt be had in the Acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then in the Acts of ſenſe. But now among all the Acts which the underſtanding exerciſeth, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the moſt perfect is the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the firſt verity; in that Contemplation therefore the moſt perfect delight is found. Thirdly, we are to conſider, that the nearer or more intimate the union of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and faculty is, the greater alſo in that reſpect is the delight; But the object of the underſtanding is far more intimately united unto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty Intellective, then the object of fenſe is to the ſenſe; for alwayes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things do more ſtrongly and vehemently unite, then corporall, and eſpecially God, or the firſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whoſe union with all things is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60687:188"/>inexplicably intimate; therefore of neceſſity by the union of God unto the underſtanding, that is by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is obtained. We ſee therefore both in regard of the nature and perfection of the object it ſelf, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the faculty, and union of both, that the delights which follow the Act of the u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derſtanding do infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excell thoſe which follow the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ſenſe, and that thoſe which follow upon the Contemplation of God Almighty are incomparably greateſt of all. Now ſeeing that God is more perfectly underſtood by Chriſtians, then by any other ſort of men, yea then by the moſt excellent philoſophers themſelves, as before we have ſhewen; and that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light of their underſtanding is by the light of grace infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and that the union of God with the ſoul, and of the ſoul with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60687:189"/>God through the means of Grace is the moſt admirable of all unions, it follows, as we ſaid, as well from the nature of the object it ſelf, as of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty &amp; union both, that the delights, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Chriſtians have in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God, do infinitely ſurpaſſe the delights of this world not onely ſenſitive but Intellectuall alſo. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſeeing that in every particular ſort of Things there may be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome one that is chief, principall, and moſt excellent in that kind, and as it were the meaſure and rule of the reſt, by approximation whereunto the reſt are judged to be more or leſs perfect in that kind; as for example, in the Claſſis or praedicament of hot Things Fire is reconed to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, and as it were the ſtandard of all other heats, every thing being judged to be ſo much the hotter, by how much it cometh nearer to the degree of fire: ſeeing therefore that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60687:189"/>God Almighty in the order of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Glorious objects is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ſupreme and more excellent then all others; Thoſe Things which approach neareſt to the perfections of God, or are moſt like him, muſt needs be not onely more perfect in themſelves, but alſo more capable of the moſt raviſhing contentments: but 'tis certain that the u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derſtanding of man or his Intellective part, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nearer unto a likeneſſe with the divine nature then the ſenſitive, and therefore the delights of that muſt be greater then thoſe of ſenſe; and ſeeing that the ſoul of a Chriſtian, by means of Grace &amp; other ſupernaturall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges beſtowed on her, comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto God, then any other which is not in Grace, as is manifeſt by what we have elſwhere ſaid, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the True Chriſtian doth more participate of divine pleaſures then any man whatſoever. But this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60687:190"/>is to be underſtood principally of perfect Chriſtians: for we confeſſe ſuch as be imperfect do meet with many impediments, by which their Contemplation of Divine Things is obſtructed and troubled, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the delights, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> otherwiſe they might receive, and which perfect men certainly do receive in ſuch Contemplations, ſometimes is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, alwayes much abated: yet not withſtanding even that very little, which they do receive, through the fervour of Charity or divine Love, becomes ſo ſweet and pleaſant to them, that for it alone they do abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſpiſe all the contentments of this world, ſaying with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Better is one day in thy Courts, then a Thouſand elſwhere.</hi> Whence alſo it follows, that ſeeing all true Chriſtians more or leſſe do avoid the pleaſures of this world, and with ſtudious affection at leaſt pretend
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60687:190"/>unto divine Contemplation, yea even when their taſt and feelings of God are but yet imperfect; it follows, I ſay, that the leaſt delight proceeding in this manner from God doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurpaſſe the greateſt of the world, according as one ſervant of God hath told us in the name of all the reſt: <hi>my ſoul</hi> ſaith he upon a time, <hi>refuſed to be comforted: I did but think upon God; and I was drowned in delight.</hi> And although this may ſeem incredible to carnall men, yet we ought not to wonder, for ſuch have not the taſt of the ſpirit.

                        <hi>THat Chriſtians in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Chriſt crucified alſo do find ineſtimable delectations.</hi> We come to the knowledge of Inviſible things in this life by the means of things viſible; becauſe, as philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy teacheth, our underſtanding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follows the phantaſie, that is, apprehends nothing, but what is prepared, as it were, and offered to her from thence. Now there is no viſible object in the world which can more effectually lead us unto the knowledge and contemplation of divine things, then the Conſideration of Chriſt crucified, proceeding from a lively Faith. Becauſe indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more effectually declare the goodneſſe and ineſtimable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God towards man. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>to be loved</hi> is a thing of it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60687:191"/>ſelf very agreeable to nature, <hi>to be beloved</hi> in this manner of God, that is, unto ſo high a pitch, that he ſhould vouchſafe to be crucified himſelf for us, who can think, but that it is a pleaſure of all pleaſures to conceive? Now ſuch a love of God towards us, doth the conſideration of Chriſt crucified preſent unto our minds, and therefore of neceſſity muſt cauſe in them ineffable dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations. Beſides, hope of Good is a thing which naturally cauſeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as making in ſome ſort the good we hope for, preſent to us: and the greater and more certain the good is which we hope, ſo much the greater and more perfect delight is cauſed: But there can be no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good imagined, then that which Chriſtians hope for by the Paſſion; nor more certain, for as much as they are aſſured thereof by God himſelf, who for that intent, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60687:192"/>that he might make it ſure to them, was Crucified: Therefore from ſuch hope, ſo great, ſo ſure, Chriſtians cannot but receive ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſolation. Thirdly, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is naturally accompanied with delight, for as much as he which wonders at any thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly poſſeſſed alſo with ſome great deſire and hope to know what the matter is, at which he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to wonder. Now what more admirable, yea aſtoniſhing, then that God Almighty ſhould be made man, and dye upon a Gibbet to ſave men? Seeing therefore that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Contemplation of Chriſts Paſſion do conſider this, and alſo conceive moſt firm hope, to attain one day unto an abſolute aſſurance and ſight of ſo rare a myſtery, how can they be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affected then with exceſſe of delight? Fourthly, ſeeing God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60687:192"/>Almighty is ſo infinitely perfect and great, it was not poſſible, that by any one creature he could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently expreſſed, but it ſeemed neceſſary to his Divine wiſdome to create an Univerſe of Creatures, that is, this whole world, in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and variety whereof the Spirit of man might have ſcope enough, and find infinite examples, wherein to contemplate, even unto raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſingularities of his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And ſeeing in like manner that the goodneſſe of the ſame God our bleſſed Saviour doth as infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpaſſe all humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not one onely, or ſome few, but a million, a numberleſſe multitude, of divine, gracious, and ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works were requiſite by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be done; but to expreſſe it in ſome part, in the meditation of which our ſouls are fed, yea glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it were, with admiration and

                        <hi>THat the holy Scriptures do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly elevate the mind of good Chriſtians unto theſe Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations.</hi> Firſt, becauſe All Scripture generally doth relate unto Chriſt crucified, according to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. <hi>The end</hi> or ſcope <hi>of the law is Chriſt.</hi> And for as much as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in its own nature, is but the ſign of words ſpoken, as ſpeech is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions or thoughts; becauſe our thoughts do alwayes proceed from ſome interiour light or Illuſtration of the mind, by how much that light is greater and more excellent, ſo much the greater alſo and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect muſt the Conceptions be, and the ſpeech conſequently more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, and the writing, wherein that ſpeech is repreſented more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and profound. Now light
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60687:194"/>ſupernaturall is alwayes greater and more perfect then naturall; And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo that there be ſeverall degrees in that light, it cannot be doubted, but the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, had the greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, as being the men whom Almighty God was pleaſed ſo ſingularly to Illuminate, as that neither in writing nor preaching they could ſo miſtake, as to deliver falſehood for truth: Therfore alſo were their meditations, their ſpeech and all expreſſions of themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes profound, powerfull, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: He therefore that preſumeth to underſtand their writings without ſupernaturall Illuſtration, is as wiſe as he that would have a bird to fly without wings: of which ſort yet there are ſome in the world, viz. cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Philoſophers, Rhetoricians, Grammarians, Poets of this age, who not knowing or not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60687:195"/>the profundity of ſacred Scriptures, do venture upon them with the ſame temerity, as they do upon <hi>Tully, Hortenſius</hi> or ſome other of their windy Authours; and perhaps not finding in them thoſe flaſhes of elegance, or ſubtilty, to which themſelves are accuſtomed, preſently they fall to ſlight and think meanly of them, imagining (weak men) nothing to be ſo ſublime as <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy, no eloquence comparable to ſome piece of <hi>Cicero.</hi> But <hi>he which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in heaven, ſhall</hi> (one day) <hi>laugh theſe men to ſcorn, yea our Lord ſhall have them inderifion. For</hi> indeed, <hi>the naturall man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they ſeem fooliſhneſſe unto him, neither can he underſtand them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> But the true Chriſtion, the man that hath ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall light in him, ſhall diſcern
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60687:195"/>them: and if with pure intention and an humble heart he ſet himſelf to the reading of holy Scriptures, meditating or conſidering well what he reades, and begging the grace of divine illumination, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and perſeverance, from God; This man, I ſay, ſhall doubtleſſe be wonderfully elevated by reading, and fitted for divine favours, and ſhall find thoſe endleſſe and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall pleaſures in them, which do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably exceed the greateſt of this world. For this is certain, every Thing is beſt delighted with that which is connaturall unto it, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent humours do alwayes affect different recreations, according to that of the Poet —
<q>
                           <l>—Trahit ſua quemque voluptas.</l>
                           <l>Every man hath his own fancy.</l>
                        </q> But unto him that is indued with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur all light, the moſt naturall, that is, moſt agreeable ſtudy of all is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60687:196"/>the ſtudy of holy Scriptures, which proceeded from that ſame fountain of light. Therefore alſo in the reading and contemplation of them the true Chriſtian finds his greateſt content. Beſides, every Thing is beſt pleaſed in ſuch kind of Action as is moſt proper for it ſelf; But there is nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a Chriſtian then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Chriſt crucified by the ſtudy of Scripture: For ſhould he go about to conceive or meditate of him meerly according to naturall reaſon, or the principles of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; neglecting Scripture, he would certainly find leſſe proficiency, and perhaps run himſelf into ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of dangerous errour: for ſuch contemplation were purely naturall, imperfect, and by which he ſhould never attain unto the myſteries of Faith: of which thing we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in our modern Divines,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60687:196"/>who ſeeming to give themſelves wholly to Ariſtotle and the ſtudy of Philoſophy are become generally leſſe devout, leſſe Contemplatiue then the meaneſt of the people. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Truth which is the object of underſtanding, the higher it is the greater delight it cauſeth in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; now the verityes of holy Scripture are the moſt high and myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious of all other, becauſe they treat principally of ſuch things as be undiſcernable by naturall light. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in regard of the inconſtancy of mans nature, which is neuer long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the ſame thing, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes affects variety and change of pleaſure, the ſacred Scriptures do become a moſt agreeable exerciſe to our ſpirit. For how admirable, how raviſhing is that variety we meet with in them, of Hiſtories, of ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, of Types, of Figures? and yet a moſt exquiſite harmony between
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60687:197"/>them all. All the parts. All the Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, exactly conſenting in one, and pointing unto the ſame generall and ſupream verity or end, which is the love of God and our neighbour: of which while they treat ſometime hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically and plainly, ſometime more myſtically and profoundly, they do as it were, preſent a noſe-gay of celeſtiall and various flowers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſoul, which continually chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, do yet moſt conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſpirituall content: We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that in the reading and meditation of holy Scripture moſt exquiſite delights be found.</p>

                        <hi>THat a good Chriſtian, the more ſimply, that is to ſay, ſincerely he liveth the greater conſolation he hath from God, from our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and from the ſtudy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures.</hi> This is true, whither we ſpeak of ſimplicity only Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or that of the heart; for the underſtanding or mind of man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his affections, the more pure and ſincere they be, ſo much the more do they render him fit and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of divine Illuſtrations: For this ſimplicity of heart doth indeed require that we be altogether pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from terrene and groſſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the end that a mans ſpirit might be intirely ſet upon God, and by this ſimplicity or purity, as much as may be made like unto him. It is true alſo, in regard of ſimplicity
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60687:198"/>exteriour, or that which conſiſteth in the Actions and converſation of men, as is manifeſt: For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template well divine myſteries, it is neceſſary that the heart of man be in great reſt, and very well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it ſelf and therefore we ſee commonly, that thoſe who deſire to partake of divine Illuminations, do retire themſelves, as much as may be, from the noyſe and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances of the world, as of the Spouſe in the Canticles it is ſaid, <hi>I will lead her into the wilderneſſe,</hi> ſaith he, that is, into ſolitude, and <hi>there will I ſpeak to her heart.</hi> And in an other place, <hi>He ſhall ſit alone, and keep ſilence, becauſe,</hi> by ſo doing, <hi>he ſhall be lifted up above himſelf.</hi> And contrariwiſe we ſee, the richer a man is, and more incombred with worldly affairs, the leſſe is he affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto contemplation; but where a mans outward affairs are few or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60687:198"/>none, there is alwayes leſſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mind. Therefore our holy Fathers and predeceſſours in the Contemplative life, were alwayes wont to renounce their affairs of the world, and retire themſelves into Solitude, thereby more promptly and readily to attend Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. Every man therefore in his particular degree and quality ſhall find, the more ſimply and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly he indeavours to live, the greater Conſolations he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God and from Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>THat the Chriſtian life is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bleſſed life.</hi> Never was there, nor ever ſhall be found out any kind of life more happy then that, becauſe none better. If therefore the life of any men may be accounted happy in this world, it is certainly that of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60687:199"/>Chriſtians. For if we obſerve, it comprehendeth all thoſe perfections, wherein the Philoſophers antiently placed happineſe, and ſo hath what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they judged good and deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: as for example, if we place happineſſe, as ſome of them did, in the Contemplation of God and things Divine, there is none more excellent and perfect then thoſe which the Chriſtian life affordeth. If we place it in morall virtue, and in the life active, that is, in good government of our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there is no better to be deſired by man, then that which Chriſtian Philoſophy preſcribeth. If we place it in riches, honours, powers, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or other goods of the body, (though this may ſeem hardeſt) yet the Chriſtian life is not altogether uncapable of theſe, and hath no abſolute repugnance to them: for we ſay, Whatſoever perfection ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60687:199"/>in the effect, is ſome way or other in the cauſe; as the Sunne, which cauſeth heat in all inferiour bodies, is it ſelf alſo, at leaſt virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hot: it is not indeed neceſſary, the cauſe ſhould contain every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perfection of the effect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and in the ſame manner as the effect doth; it ſufficeth, that it be contained <hi>eminently,</hi> as we ſay, or by ſome more excellent way, then it is in the effect. So in proportion we alſo ſay, that the Chriſtian life doth comprehend, yea afford all thoſe goods which Secular men do ſo much deſire, though not in ſuch manner as they commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and hunt after them, but in a better, that is, in a due and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubordination of them unto ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour goods. For the Chriſtian life, being as it is a life of wiſdome, a life of moſt perfect prudence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, when we ſee that the things
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60687:200"/>which the world ſo much admireth, riches, honours, pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by them (<hi>viz.</hi> good Chriſtians) in a manner neglected, we cannot but conclude that they find themſelves ſatisfied otherwiſe; that is, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of riches, honours, pleaſures <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a more noble and more excellent nature then thoſe be, which they ſeem to deſpiſe. For having the grace of God, and our Saviour Chriſt himſelf <hi>dwelling in them by Faith,</hi> they conceive themſelves thereby in poſſeſſion of ſo great a good, that in compariſon thereof, there is little elſe worthy of their deſires. They have alſo hereby an aſſured hope to recover in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, whatſoever Beauty or other ornaments of the body, here they might ſeem to want, yea in that degree of excellency and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which the heart of man cannot now conceive, and to injoy with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60687:200"/>Chriſt for ever, that life and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe felicity, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor the ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, what Things God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> And hence we obſerve, that good Chriſtians be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of a chearfull and pleaſing Converſation, not ſeeming either to deſire, or to fear any thing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much in this world, and to be as it were, out of the Gun-ſhot of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate ſorrow; according as it is written, <hi>Nothing ſhall grieve the Juſt man</hi> of <hi>whatſoever happeneth unto him;</hi> and as it was ſaid of the Apoſtles of our Saviour, <hi>They went from the Councell rejoycing, that they were held worthy to ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch for the name of Chriſt.</hi>

                        <hi>THat it is no hard matter to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chriſtian life, and therein by Gods holp to perſevere unto the end.</hi> The principall thing required thereto is the <hi>grace of God,</hi> that <hi>grace</hi> I mean, which is not onely a meer gift of God, or <hi>freely given,</hi> but that which maketh a man <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally gracious with God,</hi> or juſt. This indeed is onely to be had from God, but he, through his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and Immenſe Goodneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ready and inclined to give it unto them that ask, in that reſpect there is no difficulty to attain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life. <hi>For if he ſpared not his own ſonne,</hi> as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him give us,</hi> and that eaſily, <hi>all Things?</hi> There is alſo required ſome diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60687:201"/>on our part to receive the grace of God, which yet renders not the attaining of Chriſtian life, nor perſeverance therein through Grace, difficult or hard. For can it be hard for a man to do that which is in his own power? Can it be hard for a man to do that which naturall reaſon tells him is beſt, is for his own good, and in his own election? Let a man therefore but obſerue three precepts, and he ſhall find the attaining and perſeverance in Chriſtian life by Gods grace, eaſie. The firſt is, <hi>That he have continuall Thoughts and reflexions upon the miſertes of Humane life, and eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hour and iſſues of his death.</hi> For ſeeing that man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as all other creatures do, he ought often thus to think and reaſon with himſelf; To what purpoſe do I thus labour? What
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60687:202"/>good do all theſe Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours do me? I am ſure to dye and leave them all. I am ſure to dye, yet the hour and time of my death is moſt uncertain. What if I dye to day? as 'tis poſſible enough, what good would it then do me, to have had the whole world at command? Or thus; If the condition of man and beaſt be alike (as in death we ſeem,) truly we men are a great deal more unhappy then they: for unto bruit beaſts Nature it ſelf provideth a convenient food, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient cloathing, houſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries for their life, which we men have not, but with a great deal of labour and pains. Beaſts are ſatisfied with that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is preſent, never taking care for the future, as man doth, who is never contented with what he hath, but ſtill deſiring inſatiably more, and vexed with a Million
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60687:202"/>of cares for that which is to come. Beaſts are not ſubject to half thoſe in firmities of body which man is, ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, wearineſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for thoſe of the mind, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, anxieties, diſtreſſes, which we ſuffer in infinite variety every day, they know them not. Beaſts are content with a little, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is preſently fatisfied with but a ſmall proviſion; but the deſires of man are without end; his heart is reſtleſſe, inſcrutably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and miſerable with all. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beaſts have no Thoughts of any future life, nor of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of Soul, about which men are extreamly perplexed, almoſt in continuall dread and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of going, after all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and toylings of this life, unto pains eternall. If therefore our ſoul be not indeed Immortall, there is no creature ſo miſerable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60687:203"/>as man: But if it be Immortall, then certainly our finall reſt is not here, but muſt be ſought in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life. And ſeeing that it were an abſurd thing to imaegine that man, whom both God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have made the moſt noble and moſt excellent of all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould yet be found to be of them all the moſt miſerable, we muſt confeſſe ſome other happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reſerved for him, or elſe deny the providence of God over his works. For ſeeing that in the world many Things daily appear new, which were not before, and that nothing can poſſibly make it ſelf, or give Being to it ſelf; it cannot be doubted but that every Thing in the world is made to be, by ſomething elſe which was before it; unleſſe we will be ſuch fools, as to ſay, All things come to paſſe by chance, that is by nothing (for chance is nothing but our
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60687:203"/>ignorance or non-prae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſion of the true cauſe) a paradox ſufficiently cenfuted by the very order of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe, and that wonderfull regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is obſerved yea ſenſible in all the proceedings of nature. And ſeeing again, that in cauſes ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, we may not run from one to an other <hi>in infinitum,</hi> we muſt pitch at laſt upon ſome one, which ſhall be the firſt and generall cauſe of all; and This is confeſſed to be God: whence alſo we ſee, that without any diſcourſe of Argument, but by meer inſtinct or nature men generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God, and alſo worſhip him in ſome way or other: nor was there ever man found that could ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the opinion that <hi>There was no God.</hi> And that God hath providence over the world, the courſe of nature, as we ſaid even now, ſufficiently ſheweth, and the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſe, ſaying, that <hi>the work
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60687:204"/>of nature is the work of an Intellect which erreth not.</hi> And although it hath come in diſpute among them, whither God hath providence over humane affairs (perhaps in regard of the great irregularities and deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſeem to be in them, more then in other things) yet certainly it cannot be denied by any wiſe man, but that he hath over them, and over all, and over the leaſt, as much as over the greateſt. Becauſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in every Thing is ſo much the more perfect and more excellent, by how much it further extends it ſelf and taketh care of more Things; ſeeing then that the Providence of God muſt be acknowledged the moſt perfect of all, it muſt alſo of neceſſity extend it ſelf to all Things, it muſt leave nothing unprovided for, it muſt overpaſſe nothing. We obſerve alſo in all cauſes a naturall and vehement inclination, as it were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60687:204"/>to govern and perfect their effects; as for example, in bruit beaſts, what an admirable and great care have they of their young ones? Seeing therefore that whatſoever good is in the ſecond cauſes, they have it from the firſt, to which they do all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſire, ſo much as may be, to aſſimilate themſelves, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the firſt and generall cauſe of all things (as it were a Common Parent) muſt have a great and exact care over all particular effects, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is the cauſe of all. Beſide, if God hath not providence over hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, what is the reaſon? is it becauſe he cannot? or becauſe he knows not how to govern them? or laſtly becauſe he will not? none of theſe can be imagined of God. For ſhall we think of God, that he cannot, or knoweth not how to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that, which man both knoweth and alſo is able to do? and if but a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60687:205"/>good man, who hath ability and skill to order affairs, is alſo ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his own part to do it, ſhall we think of God, who is moſt able, moſt skilfull and wiſe, and alſo inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good, that he ſhould be leſſe willing? Again, if God Almighty had not care of humane affairs, why hath he given man ſuch a naturall inſtinct and inclination to worſhip him? God and nature we uſe to ſay, do nothing in vain. We conclude therefore, that it is an argument one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of madneſſe or a diſtempered mind to ſay <hi>There is no God, or that God is, but hath not providence or care over us men;</hi> and that it is the part &amp; duty of a wife man, not onely to know, but continually to conſider that there is a Governour over the world, who hath the ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar providence over men, that he hath over other naturall Things, that is, to conduct &amp; guide them all by due
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60687:205"/>means unto their proper and laſt ends. And becauſe it is his property to <hi>diſpoſe All Things ſweetly,</hi> he guideth every one of them to their ends in ſuch manner as is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and agreeable to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall natures, and man in particular <hi>Freely</hi> according to that liberty of his will, which is natrnall to him. From whence it is alſo, that among men, ſome are good, and ſome are evill: The good are they whoſe life is agreeable to reaſon, conforming themſelves to ſuch Illuminations and Inſpirations as they have from God, in all things ſtudying and endeavouring to pleaſe him: The evill are thoſe who follow not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor obſerve any rectitude or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of life. If therefore the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty hath providence over humane affairs, and be Juſt, as he is, he muſt certainly have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with himſelf both to reward
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60687:206"/>the good, and to puniſh ſuch as be evill: But this we ſee not done, at leaſt not exactly, not particularly, in this life, therefore we muſt confeſſe ſome other life to come, wherein the rewards of the Juſt and puniſhments of the wicked ſhall be more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen. Which if it be ſo, how much doth it concern us to pleaſe God by a good life? And ſeeing, as we have elſwhere ſhewen, that there can be no better life, then the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an life is, it is to no purpoſe for us to ſeek any where elſe how to live, or how to pleaſe God: for a life ſo led cannot be without its due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, cannot be fruſtrated of that happineſſe which is promiſed to it; if it could, there were no life ſure of happineſſe: for the life of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in many reſpects ſheweth that God hath peculiar providence over them; and therefore if their faith were not true, neither could their life ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60687:206"/>much be governed by it, nor would God ſuffer them long in that errour, whoſe Goodneſſe it is to <hi>Illuminate thoſe which are Good and right of heart,</hi> and to harden and leave in blindneſſe onely thoſe which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. If therefore Theſe Things be ſo, let us believe in Chriſt, and let us live Chriſtianly, for ſo doing, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by what hath been ſaid, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh, but muſt be happy in this world and in the next.</p>
                     <p>After a man hath by this firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration prepared himſelf, and is reſolved to do what he can to attain Chriſtian life, the ſecond Precept to be given him is this, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. That he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider what that thing is, wherein Chriſtian life doth, as it were eſſentially conſiſt;</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the grace of God; I mean that grace, which as we touched before, doth juſtifie &amp; make a man good in the ſight of God. For we obſerve ſome men as ſoon as they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60687:207"/>begin to have a deſire of living Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly, they preſently apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Ceremonies of religion, and performing them exteriourly, they imagine all on the ſudden, that they are become exceeding good Chriſtians with which vanity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deceive themſelves, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Chriſtians, but falſly, being indeed a fooliſh, lukewarm yet very arrogant ſort of people. Men indeed looking onely on the outſide, praiſe what they ſee, but <hi>God beholds the heart,</hi> and ſayes to theſe men, as our Saviour ſaid to the Phariſees, <hi>ye are they who juſtifie your ſelves before men but God knows your hearts; for</hi> many times <hi>that which is of high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem with men is abomination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi> He therefore that deſires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to live Chriſtianly, let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour with the utmoſt of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to obtain the grace of God not reſting til by ſome good ſigns &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60687:207"/>he can probably perſuade himſelf that he hath obrained it. And becauſe the Grace of God is given in and by the Holy Sacraments to all thoſe who devoutly and worthily come unto them, let him prepare himſelf in the ſecond place to receive the Sacraments, with the beſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and diligence he can: In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, If he be a believer, but yet not Baptized, let him prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and come to the Sacrament of Baptiſme, with atrue, ſincere Faith, and good Intention; If he be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a Chriſtian, but guilty of ſins, let him come with true Contrition, pure Confeſſion, and perfect Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſubmit himſelf to the Sacrament of Pennance, and thereby alſo devoutly fit himſelf for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt: and in this courſe let him perſiſt conſtantly, untill by ſome good conjectures he find, that he may have obtained the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60687:208"/>Grace of God. Now the beſt of that ſort, eſpecially for beginners, ſeem to be theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> if he find in himſelf a great and earneſt diſlike of his ſins paſt, and of himſelf for them, a ſerious intention never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them again, a firm purpoſe to live hereafter according to the law of God, and the duties of that ſtate wherein he is, a delight and taking pleaſure in divine matters, and in doing of good works, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world and of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, laſtly a longing deſire of the life to come, with a wearineſſe of this preſent. He that by ſuch ſigns as theſe ſhall perceive, that by Gods grace he is become a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, muſt alſo know, that in the way of God, <hi>not to go forward, is to go backward;</hi> and that he onely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forward, who findeth himſelf to grow daily ſtronger and more fervent in the grace of God, and in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60687:208"/>all virtue: Now this is chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by continuall Prayers, as we have ſaid elſewhere, which no man can make rightly, but he that ſtudyeth Simplicity; that is to ſay, Sincerity or purity of heart, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of converſation, together with neglect or renouncing of whatſoever is ſuperfluous. He therefore that deſires to live Chriſtianly according to the duty of that State, wherein he intendeth to fix and ſettle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, muſt be carefull (as we ſay) to live <hi>Simply;</hi> that is, Innocently, Purely, and undiſſemblingly, and in a word, anſwerably in all things to what his profeſſion requireth, ſo as he may be alwayes, as much as poſſible, intent upon Divine and Good Things; I mean, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Service of God by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Meditation, and other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, or upon the Service of his Neighbour,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60687:209"/>by works of mercy ſpirituall, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, at home and abroad. But becauſe it is difficult, yea almoſt impoſſible to give inſtructions here, proper for all perſons, by reaſon of the different eſtates and conditions of men, I ſhall adviſe every one, who hath deſire to live indeed this life of a Chriſtian, to addreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome good Ghoſtly-Father, who by his learning and experience may be able to direct him; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his counſell to govern himſelf in his ſpirituall affairs. But let him take heed, that he fall not into the hands of thoſe luke-warm and indifferent Confeſſours, who have indeed ſome form or ſhew of piety, but renounce the power thereof. It may be thought perhaps very hard to eſcape ſuch perſons, who have outwardly pretenſes of ſanctity, and God onely is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of hearts: Nay whereas it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60687:209"/>is ſaid, <hi>by their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> though they bee indeed but a kind of hypocrites and diſſemblers, yet have they ſome apparence of good works. How then ſhall we know them? I ſay ſtill, it ſhall not be difficult to know them, for any man that deſires to walk uprightly; ſeeing it is written; <hi>Light is ſprung up even in darkneſſe, to the upright in heart.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Your anointing ſhall teach you all things.</hi> And even in naturall things we ſee, thoſe which have different forms can never abſolutely agree, eſpecially if thoſe forms be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: now the form, that is to ſay, the ſpirit and diſpoſition of a true Chriſtian, and of a formaliſt, are as contrary as can be; the one, that is to ſay, the true Chriſtian, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely at the ſervice of God; the other, ever to his own intereſt;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60687:210"/>therefore 'tis impoſſible they ſhould reſemble in all things, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently impoſſible, that the true Chriſtian, who is himſelf zealous for God, and of a right intention, ſhould not diſcern him who is but luke-warm and an hypocrite; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after ſome converſation, and that the <hi>Anointing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as was ſaid, <hi>Illuminates him.</hi> As ſoon therefore as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Father, whom he hath choſen, is one of thoſe who are not as they ſhould be, let him fly from him as he would fly from a Serpent; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that walketh with the wiſe ſhall be wiſe; but the friend of fools ſhall become like unto them.</hi> But having found <hi>a good man</hi> indeed, let him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the very ſecrets of his heart to him, let him often and plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his ſinnes, and according to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60687:210"/>his adviſe let him frequent the holy Communion: for as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en elſewhere, amongſt all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Religion, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Pennance, &amp; of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt are moſt efficacious both to cauſe, to augment, and to preſerve Grace. And therefore 'tis the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every good Chriſtian to keep himſelf diligently in eſtate, to frequent thoſe Sacraments with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                     <p>After that a man is thus become a Chriſtian, and labours to live Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly, the Third precept I am to give him is This, That <hi>he conſider well, that by many Tribulations we muſt enter into the king dome of God.</hi> For we ſay in Chriſtian Religion. that <hi>to live well we muſt do good and ſuffer evill, and ſo perſevere unto death.</hi> He therefore that deſires to live like a Chriſtian, muſt prepare
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60687:211"/>and fit himſelf for tribulation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the wiſe man <hi>My ſonne when thou comeſt to ſerve God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſtand in fear, and prepare thine heart for Temptation;</hi> becauſe adverſity foreſeen doth leſſe trouble us. And that he may more eaſily endure that which comes, let him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remember the labours and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Bleſſed Saviour, and of his Saints, as well of the New as the Old Teſtament: let him read fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the hiſtories and lives of the Saints, becauſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever things are written, for our learning they are written, that we by Patience and Conſolation of the Scriptures might have Hope:</hi> let him often, yea continually if it were poſſible, haue before his eyes the ſhortneſſe of this life, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of that which is to come, that is to ſay, the eternity of our glory or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60687:211"/>pains. For ſeeing nothing can hinder, but that this ſhort life of ours muſt quickly paſſe away, &amp; that at the end of this we muſt of neceſſity arrive at the other, which never ſhall have end, whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly and duely think of this, will ſurely leſſe regard the troubles of the world; nay, he will think himſelf happy, if by them he can eſcape thoſe eternall pains of hell, and gain heaven though at laſt. He muſt alſo remember, that God Almighty hath prepared moſt excellent rewards for all thoſe who for his Sake, ſuffer temptations and perſecutions here, as it is written, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen nor the ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entred into the heart of man what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> He that thinks of this, will not certainly much ſhrink at any temporary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, but rather be ready to cry
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60687:212"/>out, confeſſing with the Apoſtle, that <hi>the paſſions of this preſent life are not equall to the Glory which is to come, which ſhall be revealed in us by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To whom with the Father and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt be aſcribed Glory and Dominion through all ages for ever. Amen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know thou art not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that of all the affairs and buſineſſes in this world, there is none of that conſequence and importance unto thee, as the ſaving of thy ſoul: and that our Bleſſed Saviour who knew beſt of all the meſtimable value thereof, and vouchſafed to redeem it at ſo dear a rate as with his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious bloud, plainly declared the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance thereof, when he ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the world nnd looſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall he give in exchange there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:60687:214"/>Wherefore let me adviſe thee to ſeek out and embrace the true Faith and Religion, for that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a Faith</hi> (according to the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.) <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> and without pleaſing of him, it is impoſſible to be ſaved. If thou thinkeſt that thou haſt found out the truth already, and that thou doſt embrace it, then give me leave to tell thee, that the world at this preſent abounds with an hundred he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies at leaſt, the <hi>embracers whereof ſhall not</hi> (according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20.) <hi>inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> and yet (as the ſame Apoſtle doth affirm, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5.) there is but <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme:</hi> ſo that it is an hundred to one, but that thy Faith and thy Religion are falſe, and thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in danger thereby. Is there not then great reaſon that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt well conſider, whither the Faith
<pb facs="tcp:60687:214"/>and Religion which thou embraceſt be true or no, when upon this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution depends thy fruition of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable bliſſe, or intolerable ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of endleſſe pains for all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? How to find out the true Faith &amp; Religion it is a matter of very great difficulty, not onely by reaſon that there are many faiths and religions in the world, and of all theſe there is but one true, and all the reſt be falſe, but alſo for that the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies debated now adayes are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo intricate, that few have leaſure to ſtudy them, and fewer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to conceive and underſtand them: yet the zeal of learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hath not been wanting to ſatisfie men herein. But what age ſince the Apoſtles dayes hath brought forth any man ſo able to perform ſo great a task, as was that incomparable Doctor S. <hi>Auguſtine lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccleſ. fol.</hi> 170. who (as Doctour
<pb facs="tcp:60687:215"/>
                     <hi>Field</hi> aſſerteth) <hi>was the greateſt and chiefeſt of the antient Fathers, and the moſt famous of all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines which the Church hath had ſince the Apoſtles time:</hi> and as Doctour <hi>Covell</hi> affirmeth in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Maſter <hi>Burges</hi> pag. 3.) <hi>hath farre excelled all others that have been or are like to be hereafter (thoſe onely excepted that were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt) both in Divine and Humane knowledge.</hi> What man ſince the Apoſtles dayes, could ever ſo well diſcern true doctrine from falſe, truth from errour, and true faith from hereſie, as could that great S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who did not onely like another <hi>David,</hi> fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Goliah</hi> of one hereſie, but like another <hi>Joſhua</hi> fought the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of the Lord againſt all the force and power of hereſie in his dayes, for fourty years together? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this great Doctour ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:60687:215"/>have left any adviſes or inſtructions behinde him unto any of his dear friends that were then hereticks, whereby he taught them how to find out the true faith and religion, amongſt ſo many hereſies, ought not ſuch inſtructions to be greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and if any ſuch could be found to be highly eſteemed, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſed? Surely thou wilt ſay, that coming from ſo great a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, and being ſo proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary fot theſe times, without doubt they ought. Why then Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reader, give me leave to preſent unto thee a learned Treatiſe of his, which he ſent unto his dear and learned friend <hi>Honoratus,</hi> to draw him from the Manichean hereſie to the true Religion; I durſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to tender it unto thee in this poor Engliſh habit, were I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that thou ſeekeſt more after the true Religion and the ſaving of
<pb facs="tcp:60687:216"/>thy ſoul, then after vain eloquence, &amp; the <hi>entiſing words of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. but I will aſſure thee, under this poore attire thou wilt find a rich and a learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of great S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> not onely very profitable for thoſe that are not yet reſolved in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but alſo for them that dere to be ſatisfied whither the faith and Religion which they embrace, be true or no. If the ſtile be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ungratefull unto thee, know that very many of the African Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have harſh ſtiles, beſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how hard a matter it is to teach a native African to ſpeak true Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
                  <p>In this work, firſt he ſhews how the old Teſtament is to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and defends the Authority of it againſt the Manichees that rejected it. Secondly he overthrowes that Manichean principle. That nothing
<pb facs="tcp:60687:216"/>is to be believed in point of Faith which is not firſt by reaſon made manifeſt and evident unto the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. In the third place he adviſeth fervent and frequent prayer, peace and tranquility of mind, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration of affections from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene things, as aids neceſſary for the finding out the truth: then declaring that Chriſt hath raiſed a very great and a famous Church conſiſting of all Nations, which is to continue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry viſible and conſpicuous even to the worlds end, he exhorts <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to addreſſe himſelf unto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Teachers thereof, and to learn of them the true faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>This way of proceeding to find out the truth, is far more ſhort and eaſie then by the examination of all the points of controverted doctrine by their conformity to the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, for it conſiſts in two points
<pb facs="tcp:60687:217"/>onely, firſt, in ſeeking out which of all the Churches is the Church of Chriſt, and ſecondly, whither this Church can erre or no.</p>
                  <p>For the finding out of the Church S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> propoſed four marks unto <hi>Honoratus,</hi> Unity Univerſality, Sanctity and Apoſtolicall Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which are ſet down very plainly in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The Unity of the Church is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, in body, and in faith; in regard of the firſt our Saviour ſaith his Church is <hi>one fold</hi> and hath <hi>one ſhep-heard Joh.</hi> 10.16. and the Apoſtle calls it <hi>one body</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. In reſpect of the ſecond, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorted the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>to ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſion amongſt them: but that they be perfectly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgement;</hi> and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched the Epheſians <hi>to endeavour
<pb facs="tcp:60687:217"/>to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, Epheſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that there is <hi>one body and one ſpirit, one hope of their calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme;</hi> and the Scripture teſtifieth that in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes <hi>the multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were of one heart and of one ſoul.</hi> Acts 4.32.</p>
                  <p>The Univerſality of the Church is alſo twofold, in time and in place; this later was foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Moſes</hi> relating Gods promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> of an ample po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and <hi>that all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed in his ſeed: Gen.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. by the Royall Pſalmiſt, declaring that God the Father would give unto his Son <hi>the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt part of the earth for his poſſeſſion, Pſal.</hi> 2.8. and <hi>that he ſhould have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the River to the ends
<pb facs="tcp:60687:218"/>of the earth:</hi> Pſal. 72.8. and by the Prophet Iſaiah, affirming <hi>that all nations ſhall flow to the mountain of the Lords houſe,</hi> Iſa. 2. v. 2. For the accompliſhment of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies our Bleſſed Saviour decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Luke 24. v. 44. that <hi>all things muſt be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moſes, aend in the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him:</hi> and v. 47. that <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſinnes, ſhould be preached in his name among all uations, beginning at Jeruſalem;</hi> and for the performance hereof, he gave a commiſſion unto his Apoſtles to <hi>teach all nations,</hi> Matth. 28.19. and <hi>to preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mar. 19. v. 15.</p>
                  <p>That the Church of Chriſt ſhould be univerſall for time, and continue perpetually unto the worlds end, it was plainly foretold by the Prophet Iſaiah, who ſpeaking of our B. Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb facs="tcp:60687:218"/>ſaith, <hi>that of the encreaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the throne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and upon his kingdome ſhall he ſit to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with judgement, and with juſtice from henceforth even for ever;</hi> and that no doubt may be made of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance hereof, the Prophet addes, <hi>the zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi> And by the Prophet Daniel affirming that <hi>in the dayes of thoſe Kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdome which ſhall not be left to other people, but it ſhall break in pieces and conſume all thoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> Dan. 2.44. All which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Angel Gabriel, ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſhall give unto Chriſt the throne of his Father David and he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob, and of his kingdome there ſhall be no end,</hi> Luke 1. ver. 32, 33. For the
<pb facs="tcp:60687:219"/>perpetuall ſettlement and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Church, Chriſt ſaid unto S. Peter: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Matth. 16.18. Touching the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of the Church of Chriſt, God by the Prophet Ezekiel ſaith, <hi>I will ſet my ſanctuary in the midſt of them for evermore: and the heathen ſhall know that I the Lord do ſanctifie Iſrael, when my ſanctuary ſhall be in the midſt of them for evermore,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 37. v. 26, 28. and by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Malachi, Mal. 1.11. <hi>From the riſing of the ſunne, even to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles: and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a peace-offering.</hi> Unto this ſanctity our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our exhorts us, ſaying, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your
<pb facs="tcp:60687:219"/>Father which is in heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.16. and Mark 7. v. 13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate, for ſtrait is the gate, and narrow the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> And teaching how to diſtinguiſh the good from the bad, he ſaith, v. 20. <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> As for Apoſtolicall ſucceſſion, S. Paul ſaith, Epheſ. 4. v. 11, 12, 13. that <hi>Chriſt gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours and teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come into the unity of faith, and of the unity of the Sonne of God, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> that is, (as Doctour <hi>Fulk</hi> againſt the Rhem. Teſt. in Epheſ. 4. ſect. 4. fol. 335. and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Inſtit.
<pb facs="tcp:60687:220"/>cap. 8. <hi>de fide,</hi> ſect. 37, 38. pag. 233. 234. do expound) for ever.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond point, whether the Church of Chriſt can erre or no, S, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that neither the violence of heathens, nor the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of hereticks can overthrow it, which agrees with our Savionrs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Matth. 16.18. that <hi>the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> and, to preſerve her from all errour and hereſie, <hi>Chriſt promiſed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with her even to the worlds end,</hi> Matth. 28.20. and God made this covenant with her: Iſa. 59.21. <hi>My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever;</hi> by which words (ſaith Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in Comment. hujus loci) <hi>God promiſeth that the Church ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:60687:220"/>be deprived of this ineſtimable benefit, to be governed by the Holy Ghoſt, and to be ſuported by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly doctrine:</hi> and to this effect he ſent down the <hi>Holy Ghoſt to teach the Church all truth and to remain with her for ever,</hi> Joh. 16.13. Joh. 14.16. Thus thou ſeeſt how S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> inſtructions for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the truth are grounded in Scripture, but more expreſſely in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, who tells us, Rom. 10.17. that faith <hi>cometh by hearing, and hearing is by the word of God;</hi> if we ask him how men may come to heare the word of God, he anſwers, v. 14, 15. <hi>How ſhall they hear without a preacher? and how ſhall they preach unleſſe they be ſent?</hi> So that faith is bred in men by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing the word of God, made known unto them by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers lawfully ſent: which preachers (as he ſaith to the Epheſians) E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
<pb facs="tcp:60687:221"/>4. v. 11, 12, 13. are alwayes to be found in the Church of Chriſt, and are placed there, ver. 14. that <hi>from henceforth we be no more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren toſſed to fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the ſleighs of men and cunning crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereby they lie in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;</hi> which is an office that cannot be performed by men that are frail and ſubject to errour, unles the Lord by his divine aſſiſtance doth preſerve them from erring. Doctour <hi>Field</hi> having conſidered the facility and ſolidity of this method, doth adviſe all thoſe to practiſe it, that deſire to be ſatisfied in matters of Religion in theſe terms, Epiſt. dedic. of the Church. <hi>Seeing the controverſies in our time are grown in number ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and in nature ſo intricate that few have time and leiſure, fewer ſtrength of underſtanding to examine them: what remaineth for men deſirous of
<pb facs="tcp:60687:221"/>ſatisfaction in things of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but diligently to ſearch out, which amongſt all the ſocieties of men in this world, is that bleſſed company of holy ones, that houſhold of faith, that Spouſe of Chriſt, and Church of the living God, which is the pillar and ground of truth: that ſo they may embrace her commuuion, follow her directions, and reſt in her judgement?</hi> Now that thou maiſt be the better able to follow this wholeſome counſell, let me adviſe thee with care and diligence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe this enſuing treatiſe, and that thou maiſt receive much benefit thereby for thy ſouls health, thou haſt already the prayers of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and thou ſhalt have the hearty wiſhes and deſires of</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any Heretick, and a man believing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks did ſeem unto me to be one and the ſame thing; I ſhould think fit to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at this preſent, and to abſtain both from ſpeaking and writing in this cauſe: But now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they do verymuch differ <hi>(For he is an Heretick (according to my opinion) who for ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60687:223"/>benefit, and chiefly for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and his own preferment, either broacheth or followeth falſe and new Opinions: but a man belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Hereticks, is one that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with a certain imagination of Piety and Truth)</hi> I held it to be my duty to deliver thee my opinion, touching the finding out and embracing the Truth, with the love whereof we have both (as thou knoweſt) been greatly enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med even from our youths. Truth is a thing farre differing from that which vain men do conceive, who having too deeply ſettled their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon theſe bodily and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, do hold and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be nothing elſe, but what they do perceive and diſcern by thoſe five moſt known Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Body: and they to ſſe to and fro and rerevolve in their minds the impreſſions and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60687:223"/>images which they have received from theſe things; even when they endeavour to disbelieve their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and by a deadly and a moſt deceitfull rule taken from thence, they think that they do frame a right and perfect judgement of the inefffable Secrets and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith. There is nothing more eaſie (my moſt dear friend) then for a man not onely to ſay, but alſo to think that he hath found out the Truth: but how extream hard it is to find it out indeed, thou wilt (as I hope) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe upon the peruſall of theſe my writings; which that they may prove beneficiall unto thee, or at leaſt not hurtfull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all thoſe into whoſe hands they may chance to light, I have beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the divine Majeſty, and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him, and I hope it will come to paſſe; if mine own conſcience can
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60687:224"/>but bear me witneſſe that I came to write them not with a deſire of vain renown or frivolous oſtentation, but with a pious and a ſerviceable mind. My intent therefore is to prove unto thee, if I can, that it is ſacrilegiouſly and raſhly done of the Manichees, to ſpeak bitter words and inveigh againſt thoſe, who following the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Catholick faith, are fortified and ſtrengthened before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand by believing, and are prepared to receive the light of the Divine grace, before they can behold that Verity and Truth which is ſeen and beheld with a pure and clean mind. For thou knoweſt, O <hi>Honoratus,</hi> that we put our ſelves into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſuch men for no other cauſe, but for that they ſaid, that, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of authority being ſet aſide, they would with plain and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſons bring their hearers and followers unto God, and free them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60687:224"/>from all errour. For what elſe was it that enforced me to follow them, and to hearken to them attentively, almoſt for the ſpace of nine years, having deſpiſed and contemned the religion which by my parents was ingraffed in me, being a little child, but for that they affirmed that we are terrified with ſuperſtition, and commanded to believe, before any reaſon is given us of belief: and that they importune and urge none to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, untill the truth be firſt diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and made manifeſt unto them; who would not be allured with theſe promiſes? eſpecially the mind of a young man deſirous of truth, a bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and one that was puffed up with pride upon diſputations had with ſome skilfull and learned School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: and ſuch an one they found me then to be, namely, who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>(my former religion)</hi> like old wives tales, and deſired to embrace
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60687:225"/>and with greedineſſe to receive the manifeſt and ſincere Truth which they promiſed to teach and deliver. But again, what reaſon withdrew me and called me back that I did not wholly adhere unto them, but kept my ſelf in the degree of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they uſe to call them, and did not forgo the hopes and affairs which I had in this world; but for that I alſo noted and obſerved, that they were more eloquent and copious in confuting others, then firm and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in proving and maintaining their own grounds? But what ſhall I ſay of my ſelf, who was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Catholick Chriſtian: who being almoſt exhauſted and greedy after a very long thirſt, was now with an ardent affection returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the breaſts of the Church, which I ſhaked and wrung, much weeping and lamenting, to the end I might not onely draw from thence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60687:225"/>ſufficient comfort for my miſery and affliction, but might alſo recover my former hope of life and ſalvation? What then ſhall I ſay of my ſelf? And as for thee, thou dideſt ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently hate and deteſt them, that I could hardly draw thee by entreaties and exhortations to hearken unto them and try them: and when thou heardeſt them, with what other thing I pray thee wert thou taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted (for I beſeech thee, call it to remembrance) but with a certain great preſumption and promiſe of reaſons? But becauſe for a long time they made many large and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement diſcourſes touching the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of unskilfull men (which every one that is but meanly learned can eaſily do) it was late before I came to the knowledge thereof. And if they delivered any thing unto us out of their own men, we thought there was a neceſſity to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60687:226"/>it, when as other things upon which we might rely, occurred not: wherein they dealt with us as deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Fowlers are wont to do, who prick down limetwigs by a waters ſide, to the end they may deceive the thirſty Birds: for they ſtop up, and by ſome means or other they cover the other waters that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: or they drive the birds from thence with frights and fears, that not by their own free choiſe and election, but meerly for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and want of water they may fall into their ſnares. But why do I not return this anſwer to my ſelf, that ſuch neat and pretty ſimilitudes as theſe, and ſuch like reprehenſions may be both moſt civilly and moſt ſnappiſhly objected by any enemy or adverſary whatſoever, againſt all thoſe that deliver any thing by teaching or inſtruction? But yet for this cauſe I thought it neceſſary to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60687:226"/>inſert ſome ſuch thing into theſe my writings, that I may warn and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them thereby to leave off all ſuch manner of proceedings: to the end that (as a certain man ſaid) the toyes of common places being ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, one thing may contend and ſtrive with another, one cauſe with another, one reaſon with another: wherefore let them forbear to ſay, what they hold in a manner neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſpoken, when any one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes them that hath long been their hearer, The light is paſſed through him. For thou my greateſt care (for I am not too ſolicitous for them) ſeeſt how vain a thing this is, and how eaſie a matter it is for any one to blame and reprehend it; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave to thy wiſdome to be diſcuſſed. For I am not afraid leſt thou ſhouldeſt think that I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of light, when I was entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a worldly life, and had a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60687:227"/>remote and obſcure hope of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull wife, of the pomp of riches, of the vanity of honours, and of other hurtfull and pernicious pleaſures: for I ceaſed not to deſire and hope for all theſe things (as thou knoweſt right well) when I was their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and heard them attentively: nor do I attribute this to their doctrine, for I confeſſe they diligently warned and admoniſhed me to beware of theſe things: but to ſay that I am now deſtitute of light, when as I have alienated and withdrawn my ſelf from all theſe ſhadows and ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of things, and have reſolved to content my ſelf with ſuch food onely, as may ſeem neceſſary to the health of my body: and that I was enlightned and ſhining before, when I was addicted unto thoſe things and was intangled with them, is the part of a man (to ſpeak in the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner) who leſſe conſiderately
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60687:227"/>ponders the things of which he much deſires to talk and diſcourſe. But if you pleaſe let us come to the matter.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60687:229"/>the ſufferance of a long blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and darkneſſe are hardly open: they have a great deſire to ſee light, and yet by their twinckling and turning away, they refuſe to behold it, eſpecially if any one ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to expoſe them to the light of the Sun: ſo it falls out with me at the preſent, for I acknowledge that there is a certain unſpeakable and ſingular good of the ſoul, which may be ſeen and contemplated with the mind, but I confeſſe with tears in mine eyes and ſighs from my heart that I am not yet fit nor able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it: wherefore the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will not forſake me, if I fain nothing, if I ſpeak according to my duty, if I love the truth, if I affect friendſhip, and if I take a great care that thou mayeſt not be deceived.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the four wayes of expounding the Old Teſtament.</head>
                     <p>THoſe that earneſtly deſire to know the Old Teſtament, are to underſtand that it is taught and expounded after four manner of wayes: according to the Hiſtory, according to the Etiologie, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Analogy, and according to the Allegory. Think me not foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for uſing Greek names: Firſt, for that I have ſo received, and I dare not deliver this otherwiſe unto thee then as I have received: Next thou alſo obſerveſt, that we have no uſuall names for theſe things: and if I had framed any by-interpretation, I ſhould be leſſe apt to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: and if I ſhould uſe any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution, I ſhould be leſſe quick and leſſe ready in diſcourſing: this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60687:230"/>onely I intreat and beſeech thee to believe, that howſoever I may erre, I do it not out of any arrogancy or pride. The Scripture is treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hiſtory when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared therein what is written, or what is done: and what is not done but written onely as it were done. According to the Etiology, when it is ſhewed thereby for what cauſe any thing is either done or ſaid. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Analogy, when it is demonſtrated that the two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Old and the New, are not contrary the one unto the other. According to the Allegory, when it is read therein that certain things that are written, ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to the letter, but according to the figure. All theſe manner of wayes of alledging Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, have been uſed by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and by the Apoſtles. He cited Scripture according to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60687:230"/>Hiſtory, when, unto thoſe that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that his Diſciples had pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ears of Corn upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, he anſwered, <hi>Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him: how he entred into the houſe of God and did eat the loaves of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (or Shew-bread) which it was not lawfull for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but for Prieſts onely?</hi> Mat. 12.1, 3, 4. 1 Sam. 21.6. Exod. 29.32. He alledged Scripture according to the Etiology, when having forbidden the diſmiſſing of wives for any cauſe but onely fornication, unto the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who told him that <hi>Moſes</hi> had given men leave to diſmiſſe them, having firſt given them a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, he ſaid: <hi>This Moſes did for the hardneſſe of your hearts.</hi> Deut. 24.1. Mat. 19.8. for here a cauſe was rendred, why that was well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60687:231"/>by <hi>Moſes</hi> for a time, to the end that this which Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded might ſeem to ſhew and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate other times, but to declare how the divine Providence hath with a certain wonderfull diſpoſition ordered and compoſed the courſes and order of theſe times, it is a long work. Now touching the Analogy, whereby appears the accord and conſent of both the Teſtaments, what ſhall I ſay, but that all thoſe have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, unto whoſe authority the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees do give place, when as they may conſider with themſelves how many things they are wont to ſay are thruſt into the divine Scripture by I know not what corrupters of the truth? which I alwayes thought to be an extream weak ſpeech even when I heard and followed them: neither was this my opinion onely, but thine alſo (for I well remember it) and it was the opinion of us all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60687:231"/>who endeavoured to be ſomewhat more carefull and wary in judging, then was the common people and multitude of believers. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they have expounded and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto me many things that did much move and trouble me (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe wherein they boaſted and bragged oftentimes, and that more abundantly becauſe more ſecurely, as not having any adverſary to reſiſt and oppoſe them. I think they have ſpoken nothing more impudently or (to ſpeak more mildly) with leſſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and more weakneſſe, then that the divine Scriptures are falſified and corrupted: when as it ought but lately to have been done, and yet they cannot convince it to be ſo, by any copies that are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: for if they did ſay, that they did not think that they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe Scriptures at all, becauſe they are written by ſuch Authours
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60687:232"/>as they did not conceive to have written the truth, their pretence of rejecting them would in ſome ſort be more hidden, and their errour more humane and pardonable: for upon this ground they have rejected the book which is called the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles:</hi> at which their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when I well weigh it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it with my ſelf, I cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently wonder and admire; for they wanted not onely humane wiſdome herein, but even a reaſonable and an indifferent judgement: for that book hath ſo many things, which are like unto thoſe which they do receive, that it ſeems to me to be a great folly not to receive this alſo, and if any thing diſpleaſeth them therein, preſently to ſay it is ſalfe, and put in: now if they judge ſuch a ſpeech to be impudent (as indeed it is) why ſhould they conceive thoſe things to deſerve any credit and eſteem in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60687:232"/>and the four books of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, wherein I know not whether or no, proportionably ſpeaking, there be many more things then there could be in that book, which they would have men believe, to have been thruſt in by falſifiers and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters? But this indeed is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which I requeſt thee to weigh and conſider with me, with a very clear and peaceable judgement: for thou art not ignorant how the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees endeavouring to bring in the the perſon of their authour <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> into the number of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, do ſay that by him we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt, whom our Lord promiſed to ſend to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: if therefore they ſhould receive thoſe <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the comming of the Holy Ghoſt is evidently declared and ſet down, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.2. they could find no ground to ſay why that was inſerted and put
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60687:233"/>in: for they pretend I know not what corrupters of the divine books to have been before <hi>Manicheus</hi> his time: and that they were corrupted by thoſe that deſired to confound the law of the Jews with the Goſpel of Chriſt; but this they cannot ſay of the Holy Ghoſt, unleſſe peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they will affirm that the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters could foretell things that were to come, and thereupon did put into their books that which might be produced againſt one <hi>Manicheus</hi> who ſometimes was to come, and who ſhould ſay and averre that he had ſent the Holy Ghoſt; but of the Holy Ghoſt we intend to ſpeak more plainly hereafter; but now let us return to our former matter; for I think that I have ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated and ſhewn, that the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall ſenſe is to be found in the Old Teſtament, and the Etiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall and Analogicall in the New:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60687:233"/>it remains that I ſhew alſo the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall therein. Our Redeemer himſelf alledgeth in the Goſpel an Allegory out of the Old Teſtament, ſaying: <hi>This generation ſeeketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſign, and none ſhall be given unto it, but the ſign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas: <hi>for as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly: ſo ſhall the Sonne of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> Mat. 12.39 40. Jonas 1.17. And what ſhall I ſay of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who alſo in his 1 Ep. to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> c. 10. to the 12. v. ſignifies, that the hiſtory it ſelf of <hi>Exodus</hi> was an Allegory of the Chriſtian people that was to come? <hi>Moreover Brethren, I would not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ye ſhould be ignorant how that all our Pathers were under the cloud,</hi> Exod. 13.21. Num. 14.14. Deut. 1.33. Pſal. 78.14. <hi>and all paſſed through the ſea:</hi> Exod.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60687:234"/>14.22. Joſh. 4, 23. Pſal. 78.13. <hi>and were all Baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud and in the ſea: and did all eat the ſame ſpirituall meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpirituall drink: (for they drank of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Chriſt) but with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them God was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> Num. 24.28. and 26.65. <hi>for they were overthrown in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now theſe things were our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures (or examples) to the intent that we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</hi> Pſalm. 106.14. <hi>Neither let us worſhip I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, as ſome of them did, as it is written,</hi> Exod. 32.6. <hi>The people ſate down to eat and drink and roſe up to play. Neither let us commit fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſome of them did, and there fell in one day three and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men,</hi> Num. 25.9. <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60687:234"/>tempted him, and were deſtroyed by ſerpents.</hi> Numb. 21.6. <hi>Neither let us murmure, as ſome of them mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and they periſhed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer.</hi> Numb. 14.37. <hi>And all theſe things happened to them in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure (or for an example) but they were written for our admonition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle uſeth alſo a certain Allegory, which is much to our purpoſe, becauſe the Manichees are wont to alledge it in their diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and boaſt of it, when wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Galathians</hi> he ſaith, Gal. 4.22, 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that Abraham had two ſonnes, the one by a bond-maid,</hi> Gen. 16.15. <hi>the other by a free-woman.</hi> Gen. 21.2. <hi>but he that was by the bond-maid was born according to the fleſh; but he that was by the free-woman was born according to promiſe: which things are ſaid by an Allegory: for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60687:235"/>theſe are the two Teſtaments, the one from the mount Sina which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth to bondage, which is Agar (for Sina is a mountain in Arabia adjoyning to Hieruſalem that now is) and is in bondage with her children: But Hieruſalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</hi> Here therefore thoſe too too wicked men whileſt they endeavour to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Law, do enforce us to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and approve of thoſe Scriptures: for they diligently obſerve that it is ſaid, that they are in bondage that are under the Law, and they often alledge that laſt above the reſt, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath. 5.4. <hi>Chriſt is become of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unto you that are juſtified by the Law, ye are falne from Grace.</hi> We grant all theſe things to be true, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we ſay, that that Law is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but onely for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t it was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60687:235"/>fitly and commodiouſly ordained that ſuch men as could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimd and withdrawn from ſinning by reaſon, ought to be conſtrained by ſucha law, namely by the threats and terrours of thoſe puniſhments, which even fools themſelves can perceive and apprehend: from which when the grace of Chriſt doth free us, it doth not condemn that Law, but it invites us for the time to come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his charity, and not to ſerve and be ſubject to the terrour of the Law. For that is a Grace, that is to ſay, a Benefit, which they that yet deſire to be under the bonds of the Law, do not underſtand that the Divine Majeſty hath imparted unto them; whom <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly reprove, as though they were Infidels, becauſe they did not believe that they are now freed by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from that ſervitude and bondage whereunto
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60687:236"/>they were ſubject for a certain time by Gods moſt juſt order and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Hereupon it is that the ſame Apoſtle ſaith. Gal. 3.24. <hi>The law was our Pedagogue (or uſher) in Chriſt,</hi> he therefore gave unto men a Pedagogue whom they ſhould fear, who gave them afterwards a maſter whom they ſhould love: and yet nevertheleſſe in thoſe precepts and Commandments of the Law, (which it is not lawfull for Chriſtians now to uſe, ſuch as are either the Sabbath or Circumciſion or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and whatſoever is of that ſort) ſo great myſteries are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and comprehended, that every godly man may underſtand that there is nothing more pernicious and hurtfull, then that whatſoever is compriſed therein ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to the letter, that is, to the native ſenſe of the words: and nothing more wholeſome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60687:236"/>then to have it expounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit or ſpirituall ſenſe and underſtanding: hence it is that <hi>the letter killeth, but the ſpirit quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth or giveth life.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. hence it is, that <hi>in the reading of the Old Teſtament, the ſelf ſame veil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth untaken away, becauſe in Chriſt it is made void:</hi> verſ. 14. for not the Old Teſtament, but the veile thereof is made void in Chriſt, to the end that may be underſtood and made manifeſt by him, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him is hidden and obſcure: and therefore the ſame Apoſtle imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after ſaith: <hi>But when thou ſhalt turn to Chriſt the veil ſhall be taken away,</hi> verſ. 16. but he doth not ſay that the Law or the Old Teſtament ſhall be taken away: they are not therefore taken away by our Lords grace, as though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable things lay hidden and were covered there, but rather the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60687:237"/>veil or cover is taken away, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wholeſome and profitable things were covered and kept cloſe. This is the benefit which they reap and receive, who with a ſtudious and a devout mind, and not with a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and wicked ſpirit, do ſeek after the ſenſe of thoſe Scriptures: and both the order of things, and the cauſes of what is ſaid and done, and ſo great an accord of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the New, even to the laſt tittle, and ſo great myſteries and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of figures are clearly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated and ſhewn: that all the things that are found out by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting them, may enforce men to confeſſe and grant that they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and wretched, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn theſe things, before they have attained to the knowledge of them.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of three wayes whereby men fall into errour.</head>
                     <p>THat for the preſent the depth and profoundneſte of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſcience being ſet aſide, I may ſo treat with thee, as I think I ought to treat with my familiar friend, that is, as well as I can, but not ſo well as I have admired to ſee very learned men been able to do: there be three kinds of errout into which men may fall when they reade any thing; I will ſpeak of every one of them. The firſt kind is, when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60687:238"/>that is thought to be true which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is falſe, and was thought to be ſo by the Authour that wrote it. The ſecond kind not being of ſo large an extent, yet no leſſe damage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and hurtfull then the former, is, when that which is falſe, is thought to be true, and was thought to be ſo by the Authour that wrote it. The third kind, is, when ſome truth is learned out of another mans wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which the Authour himſelf that wrote it, underſtood not: in which kind there is no ſmall profit, yea if thou doſt conſider it attentively thou ſhalt find that the Reader gains unto himſelf the whole profit of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. An example of the firſt kind is this: If any one ſhould ſay and believe that <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and judgeth in hell the cauſes of the dead, becauſe he read it in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils</hi> verſes; for this man erres two manner of wayes: firſt, for that he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60687:238"/>believeth that which he ought not to believe; and ſecondly, for that the Authour which he read, is not thought to have believed it. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the ſecond kind may be this: becauſe <hi>Lucretius</hi> writes, that the ſoul is made of atomes, and that after death it is diſſolved into the ſame atomes and periſheth, if any one ſhould think that this is true, and that he ought to believe it: for this man is not leſſe unhappy for perſwading himſelf certainly in ſo great a matter that to be true, which indeed is falſe, for that <hi>Lucretius,</hi> by whoſe books he was deceived, was of that opinion; for what doth it avail him to be certain of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours opinion, when as he hath made choiſe of ſuch an authour, not by whom, but with whom he might erre and be deceived? An example of the third kind is this: if any one having read ſome place in <hi>Epicurus</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60687:239"/>his works wherein he praiſeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, ſhould affirm, That he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the chiefeſt good and felicity in Virtue; and that therefore he ought not to be blamed nor reprehended; now though <hi>Epicurus</hi> believes that the chiefeſt happineſſe of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in corporall pleaſures, yet what prejudice doth this man receive and ſuſtain by his errour, when as he holds not ſo filthy and hurtfull an opinion, nor for any other cauſe is he pleaſed with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> but for that he conceives him not to have held ſo bad an opinion as ought not indeed to have been held and maintained? this errour, is not onely humane and pardonable, but alſo oftentimes moſt worthy of a man: for what if a man ſhould make me this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching one of my loving friends, that my friend when he was come to mans eſtate, told him in the hearing of many, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60687:239"/>and childhood had been ſo pleaſing and delightfull unto him, that even he ſwore he would lead ſuch a life afterwards: and that I had received ſuch certain proofs of the truth of this matter, that I could not without ſhame and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency deny it: ſhould I ſeem wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of blame and reproof, if I ſhould think that when he ſaid this, he meant and intended to ſignifie thereby, that he took much delight in an innocent life, and a mind ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from thoſe appetites and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires wherewith mankind is wont to be involved, and thereupon my love and affection towards him ſhould be much increafed, although perhaps the young man having been fooliſh in his tender age, had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected a certain liberty in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eating and ſluggiſh reſt? for ſuppoſe he had died after I had received this relation touching him,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60687:240"/>and no body could be found that could tell me what his judgement and opinion was herein: would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one be ſo miſchievous and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as to fall out and be angry with me for praiſing his reſolution and intention according to the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence which had been delivered and imparted unto me? Yea what if a juſt valuer and eſteemer of things ſhould perhaps make no difficulty to praiſe and commend my good will and opinion, for that I was taken and delighted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and being a man would rather frame a good conceit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man in a doubtfull matter, even when he ſpake otherwiſe then he ought to have done?</p>

Of theſe three kinds the firſt I diſallow not, the laſt I eſteem not: for whether can I blame an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour whoſe work is not well and rightly underſtood, if he be no way guilty of that fault, nor can I be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60687:241"/>troubled to ſee an Authour read that hath not known the truth, when I ſee that his readers do receive no hurt nor prejudice thereby: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is one kind that is moſt approved, and is moſt purged and cleanſed from errour, which is, when not onely good works are ſet forth, but are alſo well and rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by their readers; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that alſo is divided into two kinds, and it is not wholly free from errour: for it happeneth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that the writer hath a good meaning, and the reader hath fo too, but another then he, and oftentimes a better conceit, oftentimes a lower, and yet one that is commodious and profitable: but when as we attain to the true ſenſe and meaning of the Authour which we reade; and the work much conduceth to the leading of a good life, the truth appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly therein, and there is no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60687:241"/>gap nor paſſage that lies open to falſhood and deceit. This kind is very ſeldome to be found, when the diſcourſe is about things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hard and obſcure; neither in my opinion can it be clearly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly known, but onely be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for by what proofs or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can I ſo perfectly gather what the will of a man is, that is abſent or dead, that I can ſwear and take my oath what it is: when as if he were asked, even being preſent there might be many things which he might moſt officiouſly conceal and hide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were not a wicked man? but to know the quality of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour I think it nothing avails to the knowledge of the matter: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he highly deſerves to be reputed and eſteemed to be a good man, who by his books and writings affords great aſſiſtance unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and to poſterity. Now I would
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60687:242"/>have the Manichees to tell me in which kind they place the errour (which they conceive) of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. If in the firſt it is a grievous fault indeed, but we need not ſeek farre to know how to defend it; for it is ſufficient to deny that we underſtand it, as they conceive, when they inveigh againſt it. If in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, it is no leſſe grievous, but the ſame words will ſerve to confute it. If in the third, it is no fault at all. Go to then, and hereafter conſider the Scriptures themſelves: for what do they object againſt the books which are called the Old Teſtament? do they ſay that they are good, but that we do not well and rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them? but they themſelves receive them not. Do they ſay that they are neither good, nor rightly underſtood by us? but this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convinced by the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe; or will they ſay, that we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60687:242"/>underſtand them, but that the books be naught? what is this, but to acquit and abſolve their living ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, with whom they are in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and to accuſe thoſe that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dead, with whom they have no contention nor ſtrife? Verily <hi>I</hi> do believe that all the works which thoſe men left to poſterity, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably written, and that they were great and very holy men, and that that Law was made and publiſhed by Gods will and command: and although my skill and knowledge be but very little in books of that kind, yet this <hi>I</hi> can eaſily prove to be true unto one that bears an equall and an impartiall, and not an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and a refractory mind; and <hi>I</hi> will do it, when thou wilt afford me an attentive and a courteous hearing, and mine own occaſions will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. But now is it not ſufficient for me, howſoever that buſineſſe goes,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60687:243"/>not to have been beguiled nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

That this was done altogether fooliſhly, and like unto a woman, no man can deny: but do not thoſe men ſeem to reſemble her, who caſting forth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ſpeeches and curſes againſt the

Should I go about to prove this unto thee I muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge many reaſons, and entertain thee with a longer diſcourſe: for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60687:245"/>firſt I muſt perfwade thee not to hate the Authours themſelves, and then to love them: and this I muſt effect by any other means, rather then by expounding their opinions and their writings: and therefore if we did hate <hi>Virgil,</hi> yea if we did not love him upon the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Predeceſſours before we underſtood him, we ſhould never be ſatisfied in thoſe innumerable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions touching him wherewith Grammarians are wont to be much perplexed and troubled: nor ſhould we give eare to any man that could reſolve thoſe queſtions to his honour and praiſe, but we ſhould give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſhew favour unto him who by thoſe queſtions would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew that he erred and doted; but now when as many men do labour to expound them, and that after divers manners, and every one according to his skill and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60687:245"/>they receive the chiefeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and applauſe, by whoſe expoſitions he is found to be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Poet, and he is conceived and believed even by thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him not, not onely to have committed no fault nor errour, but to have ſaid nothing which doth not deſerve much glory and praiſe: and therefore if a Maſter fails but in a ſmall queſtion, and knows not what to anſwer, we are rather angry and offended with him, then we will conceive that by any fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Maro</hi> he is ſilent and dumb: but if a Maſter ſhould in his own defence, affirm that ſo great an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath committed a fault, he would looſe ſo much credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation thereby, that his ſcholars would hardly continue with him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven though he ſhould hyre them with wages and rewards.

                     <p>BUt now if I can, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that which I have begun, and I will treat with thee after ſuch a ſort, that in the mean time I will not expound the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, but I will ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that have a care of their ſouls ſome hope of divine fruit, and of finding out the Truth, to the end they may ſearch out the great myſteries and ſecrets of Faith. He that ſeeks after the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, doth without doubt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe already that the Soul is immortall, unto whom
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60687:247"/>that Religion may be commodious and profitable, or he deſires to find her to be ſo in the ſame Religion; and therefore all Religion is for the ſouls ſake: for the nature of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy howſoever it doth put him to no care and ſolicitude, eſpecially after death, whoſe ſoul hath taken a courſe by which it may become bleſſed. Wherefore true Religion if there be any, was either onely one chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the ſouls ſake: and this ſoul erres and is fooliſh, as we ſee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe gets and poſſeſſes wiſdome, and that perhaps is the true Religion, if I ſeek out and enquire the cauſe of her erring, I find it to be a thing which is extremely hidden and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. But do I ſend thee to fables? or do <hi>I</hi> enforce thee to believe any thing raſhly? <hi>I</hi> ſay our ſoul being entangled and drowned in errour and folly, ſeeks after the way of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth, if there be any ſuch to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60687:247"/>be found, if thou findeſt not thy ſelf thus inclined and diſpoſed, pardon me, and make me <hi>I</hi> pray thee, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of thy wiſdome: but if thou doeſt, let us, <hi>I</hi> beſeech thee, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeek out the truth. Imagine with thy ſelf that no not ce had as yet been given unto us, nor no inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation made unto us of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion what ſoever. Behold we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a new work, and a new buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Profeſſours of Religion are <hi>I</hi> believe to be ſought for, if there be no ſuch thing. Suppoſe then that we have found men of divers opinions, and in that diverſity ſeeking to draw every one unto them; but that in the mean time, ſome amongſt theſe do ſurpaſſe the reſt in renown of fame, and in the poſſeſſion of almoſt all people. Whether they embrace the truth or no it is a great queſtion; but are they not firſt to be examined and tried, that ſo long as we erre (for as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60687:248"/>men we are ſubject to errour) we may ſeem to erre with mankind it ſelf? but thou wilt ſay, Truth is to be found but amongſt a few certain men: if thou knoweſt amongſt whom it is, why then thou knoweſt already what it is. Did not <hi>I</hi> ſay a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we would ſeek after the truth, as though we were yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof? but if by the force of truth thou doeſt conjecture that there be but few that embrace it, and yet thou knoweſt not who they be, what if thoſe few do lead and rule the multitude by their authority, and can dive into the ſecrets and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of faith, and can make them in a manner plain and manifeſt? do we not ſee how few attain to the height of eloquence, and yet the ſchools of Rhetoricians do make a great noiſe throughout the whole world, with companies of young men? Do all thoſe that deſire to become good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60687:248"/>oratours, being terrified with the multitude of unskilfull men, think that they ought to addict themſelves rather to the ſtudie of the orations of <hi>Coccilius</hi> and <hi>Erucius,</hi> then to thoſe of <hi>Tullius Cicero?</hi> all men affect the things that are ſtrengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the authority of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours. The ſimple ſort of people endeavours to learn thoſe things which a few learned men have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them to be learned: but very few there be that attain unto great eloquence, fewer there be that practiſe it, but feweſt of all that grow eminent and are famous. What if true Religion be ſome ſuch thing? what if a multitude of ignorant people frequents the Churches, it is no proof nor argument, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none are made perfect by thoſe myſteries? and yet if ſo few ſhould ſtudie eloquence, as there are few that become eloquent, our parents
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60687:249"/>would never think it fit to have us recommended unto ſuch maſters. When as therefore the multitude, which abounds with a number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull people, invites us to theſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and makes us earneſtly to affect that which few do obtain, why will we not admit that we have the like cauſe in Religion, the which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture we contemne and deſpiſe to the great perill and hazard of our ſouls? for if the moſt true and moſt ſincere worſhip of God, though it be but amongſt a few, yet it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe with whom the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though wholly addicted to their appetites and deſires, and farre from the purity of knowledge and underſtanding, doth conſent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which without all doubt may come to paſſe: <hi>I</hi> ask, what anſwer are we able to give, if any one ſhould reprove our raſhnes &amp; folly, for that having a great care to find out the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60687:249"/>true Religion, we do not diligently ſearch it out amongſt the maſters and teachers thereof? if <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay the multitude hath diſcouraged me. Why then hath it not diſheartened men from the ſtudy of the liberall ſciences which hardly yields any profit to this preſent life? why not from ſeeking after money and getting wealth? why not from obtaining dignities and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? moreover, why not from reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and preſerving health? finally, why not from the deſire of a bleſſed &amp; an happy life? in all which affairs though many men be imployed, yet few there be that are eminent and excell. You will ſay that the books of the Old Teſtament ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain abſurd things. Who are they that affirm it? namely enemies, for what cauſe or reaſon they did it, is not now the queſtion; but yet they were enemies, you will ſay when you read them you underſtood ſo much
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60687:250"/>by your own reading. Is it ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? if thou hadſt no skill in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie at all, thou durſt not take in hand <hi>Terentianus Maurus</hi> without a maſter; <hi>Aſper, Cornutus, Donatus,</hi> and a multitude of other Authours are thought requiſite for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any Poet, whoſe verſes deſerve no greater eſteem then the approbation and applauſe of a ſtage: and thou without a guide doeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to reade thoſe books, and without a maſter dareſt paſſe thy judgement upon them, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be, are notwithſtanding by the confeſſion of almoſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, publiſhed to be holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with divine matters: nor if thou findeſt ſome things therein which ſeem unto thee abſurd, doſt thou rather accuſe the dulneſſe of thy wit, and thy mind corrupted with the infection of this world (as the minds of all fools are) then thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60687:250"/>books which peradventure by ſuch kind of men cannot be well concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and underſtood. Thou ſhouldſt do well to ſeek out a man both pious and learned, or one that is eſteemed and reputed ſo to be, by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and conſent of many; by whoſe inſtructions thou mighteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better, and more expert and skilfull by his learning. Such an one (ſaiſt thou) was not eaſie to be found: it would be ſome labour and trouble to ſeek him. There was none ſuch in the land wherein thou didſt dwell. If ſo, what cauſe could more profitably enforce thee to travell? if he lay hid in the continent or firm land, or were not there at all; thou ſhouldſt ſail beyond ſea: if he were not there to be found by the ſhore, thou ſhouldeſt make a voyage even unto thoſe lands, wherein the things which are contained in thoſe books are ſaid and reported to have been
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60687:251"/>done. O <hi>Honoratus</hi> have we done any ſuch thing? and yet when we were but moſt wretched and ſilly boyes we did at our own pleaſure, and in our own judgement, condemn a Religion, and that perhaps a moſt holy one (for I ſpeak, as yet, as though ſome doubt were to be made thereof) whoſe fame and renown hath already poſſeſſed the whole world. What if the things which ſeem in thoſe Scriptures offenſive to ſome that are ignorant and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, be for this cauſe ſo written and ſet down, that when ſuch things are read as agree not with the ſenſe of all ſorts of men, but much leſſe with theirs that are holy and wiſe, we may with more care and diligence ſeek out a ſecret and hidden meaning thereof? doeſt thou not ſee how men labour to interpret the paſtorall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamite, upon whom the rough ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd poured out his affections: and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60687:251"/>how they affirm that the boy <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> (upon whom <hi>Plato</hi> is alſo ſaid to have made ſome love-verſes) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies I know not what great and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious matter, but that it ſurpaſſeth the judgement and underſtanding of unskilfull men: when as indeed that Poet abounding in his inventions may without any deteſtable crime or offence be conceived to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed laſcivious ſongs? but were we indeed hindred and withdrawn from ſeeking out the true Religion, either by the publiſhing of ſome law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, or by the power of them that oppoſe it, or by the contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible ſhew and appearance of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the ſervice of God, or by any baſe or diſhoneſt report; or by the newneſſe of the inſtitution, or by ſome hidden profeſſion thereof? No, no, none of theſe things did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and hinder us: all laws both divine and humane do permit men to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60687:252"/>ſeek out the Catholick faith, and certainly it is lawfull according to humane law to hold &amp; embrace it, if ſo long as we erre, we be uncertain of the divine law. We have no enemie that puts any fright or terrour into our weaknes: although truth and the ſalvation of our ſouls, if it be ſought after, where it is lawful to ſeek it with moſt ſafety; and it cannot be found, ought to be enquired for with any danger and hazard whatſoever; the degrees of all powers &amp; dignities do moſt devoutly impart their ſervice unto this ſacred and divine worſhip: and the very name of Religion is moſt honourable, and hath a very great eſteem and renown. What hindereth us then at laſt to ſeek out carefully, and to examine with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diligent ſearch, whether here be that truth which though few do know and retain after the ſincereſt manner, yet the favour and good will of all nations doth conſpire
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60687:252"/>therein? All this being ſo, imagine (as I ſaid) that we now make our firſt enquiry what Religion we ought to embrace both for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and reforming of our ſouls. <hi>Without doubt we muſt take our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Catholick Church,</hi> for there are now more Chriſtians then if the Jews were joyned with the worſhippers of idols. And <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of the ſame Chriſtians there be divers hereſies, and all would have themſelves thought to be Catholicks, and do call others beſides themſelves hereticks; the Church is one, as all do grant, greater in multitude, if thou conſidereſt the whole world and (as thoſe that know do affirm) more ſincere in truth then all the reſt; but as for truth it is another queſtion. But that which is ſufficient for thoſe that ſeek it, is, that the Catholick Church is one upon which other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies do impoſe divers names, when as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60687:253"/>every one of them is called by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name, which it dares not deny; whereby we may underſtand by the judgement of Arbitratours not hindred by any favour, unto whom the name Catholick, which all ſeek after, ought to be attributed.</hi> But leſt that any one ſhould think that this thing ought to be debated with much babling or ſuperfluous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, there is one Church indeed wherein even the humane Laws are after a ſort Chriſtian. Yet I will have no preocupation of judgement to be drawn from hence but I judge it to be a moſt fit beginning for the ſeeking out of the truth. For there is no fear leaſt the true worſhip of God relying upon no proper force of its own, ſhould ſeem to ſtand in need to be upheld and ſupported by them whom it ought to ſuſtain and ſupport: but certainly it were a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happineſſe, if the Truth could
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60687:253"/>there be found, where with moſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity it may be ſought and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but if it cannot, it ought to be ſought for in another place, what danger and perill ſoever be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.</p>

Oftentimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when I conſidered as well as I could, that the mind of man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch vivacity and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtrength, with ſuch wiſdome and ſharpneſſe of wit, and with ſuch quickneſſe of judgement and underſtanding, I did not think that Truth could lye hidden and be concealed, but onely that the manner of Seeking it was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unknown, and that that manner was to be received from ſome Divine Authority, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained that I ſhould enquire what that Authority was, when as in ſo great Diſſenſions and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Opinions every one did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he would Teach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it. Whereupon there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred unto me an intricate Wood or Labyrinth into which it was very tedious and irkſome to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and my mind remaining reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60687:255"/>amongſt theſe things, was toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to and fro with a great deſire of finding out the truth: yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe by little and little I brake off from their company more and more whom I had already purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to forſake, and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remaining in ſo great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils and dangers, but that with tears and pittifull words, I ſhould beſeech the Divine Providence to aſſiſt and help me; and this I did deliver gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carefully, and now I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſhaken by ſome diſputations had with the Biſhop of Millan S. <hi>Ambroſe, l.</hi> 5. <hi>conf. c.</hi> 14. ſo that not without ſome hope I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enquire many things touching the Old Teſtament, which (as thou knoweſt) being diſcommended and diſpraiſed unto us we abhorred and deteſted. And I had reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo long a Catechumen in the Church unto which I was delivered
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60687:255"/>by my parents, untill I could find out that which <hi>I</hi> deſired, or could perſwade my ſelf that it ought not to be ſought for. Wherefore if there had been any one then, that could have taught me, he might have found me a moſt apt ſchollar and very docible. <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and with the like care and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety of thy ſoul thou ſeeſt that thou haſt been long troubled and afflicted, and if thou ſeemeſt to thy ſelf to have been already ſufficiently toſſed, and wouldeſt make an end of theſe labours and pains: Follow the way of the Catholick Diſcipline, which hath proceeded from Chriſt himſelf by his Apoſtles even unto us, and from hence ſhall deſcend and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to poſterity.</hi>

                     <p>THou ſayeſt my advice is fooliſh and ridiculous, ſeeing that all men do make it their profeſſion to embrace and deliver Catholick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. That all Hereticks do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this I cannot deny, but after ſuch a manner, that unto thoſe which they entice and allure unto them, they promiſe to give a reaſon for the moſt hidden and moſt obſcure things: and chiefly for this cauſe they blame and reprehend the Catholick Church, becauſe thoſe that approch and come unto her are commanded to believe: but they glory and boaſt that they impoſe not upon their followers the yoke of Faith and Believing, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto them the fountain it ſelf of teaching and inſtruction. What (ſayſt thou) could be uttered or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60687:256"/>more redounding to their praiſe and commendation? It is not ſo. This they promiſe having no power nor ability to perform it, but that by the name and pretence of reaſon they may winne and allure much compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto them; for the ſoul of man naturally rejoyceth at the promiſe of reaſon, and not having regard to her own forces and weakneſſe, by a deſire ſhe hath to eat the meats of thoſe that are in health (which are not prudently given to the infirm) ſhe haſtily falls upon the poyſon of the deceivers. But as for true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it can by no means be well and rightly received without ſome weighty command and force of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unleſſe thoſe things be firſt believed, which every one may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards attain unto, and learn if he carries himſelf well, and be thought worthy of it. Perhaps thou requireſt ſome reaſon hereof, whereby thou
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60687:257"/>mayſt be induced and perſwaded to believe that thou oughteſt not ſooner to be taught by reaſon, then by Faith and Belief. Which I can eaſily give unto thee, if thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and receive it from me with an equall and impartiall mind. But that it may commodiouſly be done, I would have thee as it were anſwer to ſuch queſtions as I ſhall propoſe unto thee. And firſt of all I would have thee to tell me: why doſt thou conceive that we ought not to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? Becauſe (ſayſt thou) credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it ſelf, from whence men are called credulous, ſeems unto me to be a certain vice, elſe it would not be a cuſtome to object this name by way of reproch. For if a ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man be culpable and faulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſuſpects things not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known: much more doth a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous man deſerve to be blamed, who differs herein from a ſuſpicious
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60687:257"/>man, that he that is ſuſpitious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome doubt in unknown things, but he that is credulous makes none at all. In the mean time I admit of this opinion and this diſtinction; but thou knoweſt alſo that we do not ſay a man is curious but by way of taunt and reproch, but when we call a man ſtudious, we ſpeak it in his praiſe and commendation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you pleaſe, mark what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference you conceive to be between theſe two. Thou anſwereſt, that although both be moved with a great deſire of knowing, yet in this they differ, that the curious man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires after the things that belong not unto him, but the ſtudious on the contrary after his own affairs. But we grant that a wife and children and their welfare do belong unto a man, and therefore if any one being gone a farre off out of his native ſoile ſhould make a diligent enquiry
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60687:258"/>of thoſe that come from his parts, how his wife and children do, he hath certainly a great deſire to know it, and yet we call not this a ſtudious man, although he be deſirous to know, and even thoſe things which do chiefly belong and appertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Wherefore now thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt that that definition of a ſtudious man is herein defective and imperfect: that every ſtudious man deſires to know the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, but that every man that hath ſuch a deſire ought not to be called a ſtudious man; but he who exceedingly ſeeks after the things which belong to excellent breeding, and to the adorning of the mind, we rightly call (in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine) a Student, that is, a deſirous man, eſpecially if we adde what he deſires to hear. For we call one alſo ſtudious of his friends, that loves his friends onely: yet nevertheleſſe we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60687:258"/>think him not worthy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name of ſtudious men without any addition. But one that deſires to know how his friends do. I would not call him ſtudious or deſirous of hearing, unleſſe having a good fame and credit he ſhould often deſire to hear the ſame thing, but if he ſhould but once deſire to hear it, I would call him a Student or deſiring man. Now reflect upon a curious man, and tell me whether if any one ſhould willingly hear a ſhort tale not conducing at all unto his profit, that is, of things not belonging unto him, and this not with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and often, but very ſeldome and very modeſtly, either in ſome banquet, or in ſome meeting or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, wouldeſt thou think him to be a curious man? I conceive not, but truly he that hath a care of that thing which he would willingly hear might ſeem indeed to be ſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60687:259"/>the definition alſo of a curious man ought to be corrected by the ſame Rule as is that of a ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man. And therefore conſider alſo, whither the things former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken ought to be amended. For why is he not unworthy of the name of a ſuſpitious man, who ſometimes ſuſpecteth ſomething, and he of a credulous man that ſometimes believeth ſomething? Wherefore as there is a very great difference between one that is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of any thing, and one that is altogether ſtudious, and again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one that hath a care of a thing, and one that is curious: ſo is there between a believing man and a credulous man.</p>

                     <p>BUt thou wilt ſay, Now ſee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to believe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For neither if we grant it to be one thing to believe, another to be credulous, doth it follow, that it is no fault to believe in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: for what if it be a fault both to believe and to be credulous, as it is both to be drunk and to be a drunkard? whoſoever thinks this to be certainly true, can in my opinion have no friend at all. For if it be a thing unreaſonable to believe any thing, either he commits a foul fault that gives credit to his friend; or if he believes him not, I ſee not how he can call himſelf a friend, or the other. Here peradventure thou wilt ſay, I grant that ſomething ought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be believed: now declare
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60687:260"/>how in Religion it is not a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to believe any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we know it, or underſtand it. I will if I can. Wherefore I ask thee, which doeſt thou conceive to be the greater fault, to inſtruct an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon in Religion, or to believe that which is ſaid by the inſtructours and teachers thereof? if thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt not whom I call an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon: ſuch an one I mean as comes to receive and embrace Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with a feigned and diſſembling heart. Thou granteſt, as I conceive, that it is a thing more worthy of blame to expound to ſuch an one the holy myſteries of faith, then to give credit to religious men, affirming ſomething of Religion it ſelf. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would it become thee to give another anſwer. Wherefore now ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with thy ſelf, that the man were preſent who is to inſtruct thee in point of Religion: how wilt thou
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60687:260"/>make him believe that thou comeſt with a true and an unfeigned mind, and that thou uſeſt no deceit nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation in this buſineſſe? thou wilt ſay that upon thy good conſcience thou feigneſt nothing, aſſuring it with all the words thou canſt uſe, but yet with words. For being a man thou cauſt not ſo open the corners and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of thy mind to another man, that he may know thee inwardly. And if he ſhall ſay: Behold I do believe thee: but is it not more fit that thou alſo ſhouldſt give credit unto me, ſeeing that if I hold and embrace any truth, thou art to receive the benefit thereof, and I to impart it? What anſwer ſhall we give, but that he ought to be believed? but ſaiſt thou, Had it not been better to alledge reaſon unto me, that I might follow it without any raſhneſſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever it ſhould lead me? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it had been: but ſeeing that it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60687:261"/>is ſo great a matter for thee to know God by reaſon, doeſt thou think that all men are capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſons whereby the mind of man is led to the knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things or the greater part of them, or but a few? I think, thou ſayſt but a few. Doeſt thou believe that thou art in that number? Thou ſaiſt, It is not my part to anſwer to that queſtion. Thou thinkeſt then that it is his part alſo to believe thee in this matter: which he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Onely let me put thee in mind, that he hath already twice given credit unto thee, ſpeaking uncertain things: and that thou wouldeſt not ſo much as once believe him, when he religiouſly warned and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thee. But ſuppoſe this to be ſo, and that thou comeſt with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere mind to embrace Religion, and that being one of thoſe few men, thou canſt underſtand the reaſons by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60687:261"/>which the divine power is certainly known, doeſt thou think that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be denied to other men, that have not ſo great wits and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as thou haſt? or doeſt thou conceive that by little and little they ought to be led by certain degrees to thoſe chiefeſt ſecrets? thou plainly ſeeſt what courſe of proceeding is the more religious. For thou canſt not think that any man ought by any means to be forſaken or rejected in the deſire and affection of ſo great a matter. But art not thou of opinion, that unleſſe a man firſt believes, that he ſhall attain unto that which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and bears an humble and a ſuppliant mind, and being obedient to certain great and neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, be very well purged and made clean by a certain courſe of life, he cannot otherwiſe obtain thoſe things that are purely true? indeed thou thinkeſt ſo. If then they, who by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60687:262"/>certain reaſon can moſt eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the divine myſteries, (one of which ſort I believe thee to be) ſhould proceed in this way, wherein thoſe walk that firſt do believe, would they receive any hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? I think not. But yet thou ſaiſt, what neceſſity is there of delay? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, although by their proceedings they ſhall not prejudice themſelves at all, yet they will endamage others by their example. For there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any one, that hath ſo high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of himſelf as he can have; and he that thinks too humbly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ought to be raiſed up, and he that thinks too high, ought to be repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that neither the one may be overcome by deſpair, nor the other caſt down headlong by boldneſſe and preſumption. Which is eaſily brought to paſſe, if even thoſe that are able to flie, ſhould a little be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to go, leſt any ſhould be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60687:262"/>invited thereunto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo a ſufficient care may be had of others. This is the Providence of true Religion: this God himſelf hath appointed and commanded: this hath been delivered by our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of happy memory, this hath been obſerved even untill our dayes; to go about to overthrow this order, is nothing elſe but to ſeek out a ſacrilegious way to true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Which whoſoever do, cannot attain unto that which they intend; though that be granted them which they deſire. For <hi>howſoever they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and excell in wit, unleſſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty doth aid and aſſiſt them, they creep upon the ground.</hi> Which aſſiſtance he then affords when they that tend and walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, have a care to proceed according to the courſe of humane ſociety. Then which degree and ſtep towards heaven nothing can be found
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60687:263"/>more firm and ſtable. Verily, ſuch is the force and efficacy of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I cannot reſiſt it, for how can I ſay, that nothing ought to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unleſſe it be known? beſides all friendſhip is taken away unleſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be believed which cannot be demonſtrated and proved by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſon: and oftentimes without offence credit may be given to ſuch ſtewards as are ſervants to Lords. But in matters of Religion what can be done that is more unreaſonable and unjuſt, then that Gods Prelates ſhould believe us, when we promiſe that we come to embrace Religion with an unfeigned mind; and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to give credit unto them, when they teach and inſtruct us? Finally, what way can be more wholeſome and profitable, then by believing thoſe things which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as preparatives for the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating and adoring the mind to be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60687:263"/>firſt diſpoſed, and made fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and receive the truth? or if thou beeſt already ſufficiently diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereunto, rather to go a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, where thou maiſt walk with the greateſt ſafety, then both to be the Authour of danger to thy ſelf, and an example of temerity, and raſhneſſe unto others.</p>

                     <p>VVE have ſhewed already how without offence we may follow thoſe that command us to believe: it remains that we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for what cauſe they are not to be followed that promiſe to conduct and lead us by reaſon. Some are of opinion that they can hearken and give eare to theſe promiſers of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not onely without any blame or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60687:264"/>diſpraiſe; but alſo with ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and praiſe; but it is not ſo, for there be two ſorts of perſons that deſerve praiſe in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: the one which hath already found out the true Religion, which we ought to judge moſt happy and bleſſed: the other which with the greateſt care, and after the righteſt manner, doth ſeek after it: the firſt ſort is now in poſſeſſion of it, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is in the way, by which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding moſt certainly they will arrive at it. There be three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of men which are indeed to be miſliked and deteſted. The firſt is, of thoſe that are opinative, that is, who think they know that which they know not. The ſecond is, of thoſe who truly do perceive their own ignorance, but do not ſo ſeek that they may find. The third is of thoſe that neither think they know, nor have any will or deſire to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60687:264"/>ſeek. There are alſo three things in the minds of men, near as it were the one unto the other, moſt worthy to be diſtinguiſhed, to underſtand, to believe, and to think. Of which, if they be conſidered by themſelves, the firſt is alwaies without offence, the ſecond ſometimes faultie, the third never without a fault; and this we ought to reſerve to the ſame beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and felicity. For in this life how much ſoever a man knows, his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not as yet make him moſt bleſſed, for that there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more things whereof he is ignorant. For to underſtand great and worthy, and divine things it is a moſt bleſſed thing. But it is not hurt full to underſtand ſuperfluous things, but perhaps it was prejudicial to learn them, when as they took up the time of neceſſary things. Alſo it is not a miſerable thing to underſtand hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, but to do or ſuffer them.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60687:265"/>For if any one underſtands how his enemie may be ſlain without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering himſelf, he becomes not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by underſtanding it, if he deſires it not: yea if he be free from ſuch a deſire, who is more innocent and guiltleſſe then he? In believing a man is then to blame, when either he believes ſome unworthy thing of God, or gives too facile and eaſie credit unto the things reported of man. But in other things, if a man believes any thing, he commits no fault by believing, though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtnnds that he knows not the thing which he believes. For I believe that in times paſt, moſt wicked conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours were put to death by the power and authority of <hi>Cicero:</hi> but this I do not ogely not know, but alſo I know aſſuredly that I can by no means attain unto the knowledge thereof, To be opinative or to be led by opinion, is for two cauſes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60687:265"/>thing: Firſt, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn a thing, if it be to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that hath perſwaded himſelf that he knows it already. And ſecondly, for that raſhneſſe is of it ſelf a ſign or token of an ill diſpoſed minde. For although any one thinks that he knows that which I ſaid touching <hi>Cicero</hi> (as there is nothing that can hinder him from learning it) yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can have no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and for that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not, That there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whither any thing be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by certain reaſon of mind, which we ſay is to underſtand, or whither it be committed to common fame or writing, to be profitably believed by poſterity, he erres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and there is no errour but hath its foulneſſe and deformity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we underſtand we attribute it to reaſon: that we believe, to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and that we are opinative,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60687:266"/>to errour and miſtaking: but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that underſtands doth alſo believe: and ſo doth every one that is opinative: but not every one that believes, underſtands: and no man underſtands that is opinative. If therefore theſe three kinds be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe five ſorts of men where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we made mention a little before, to wit, to the two approved kinds which we put in the firſt place, and to the other three vicious kinds; we find that the firſt kind (which is thoſe that are happy) doth believe truth it ſelf: and that the ſecond kind (which is thoſe that are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and lovers of truth) doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve authority: in both which kinds the believers deſerve praiſe. But in the firſt of the vicious kinds (that is of thoſe that think they know that which they know not) there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a faulty credulity. The other two diſallowed kinds (that is, both
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60687:266"/>thoſe that ſeek after truth with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of finding it out, and they that ſeek not after it) do believe nothing; and this is onely in things belonging to ſome doctrine or diſcipline, for how a man can believe nothing in the other actions of his life I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not. Albeit even amongſt thoſe that affirm that in their actions they follow probable opinions, ſome there be that will ſeem rather not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know any thing, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing. For who doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which he doth approve? Or how is that which they follow profitable, if it be not approved? Wherefore there may be two kinds of thoſe that oppoſe the truth: the one that oppoſeth knowledge onely, and not faith: the other that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth both the one and the other. But whither any can be found that uſe ſuch proceedings in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, I am wholly ignorant. Theſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60687:267"/>things are ſpoken that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that believing the things which we do not as yet fully know nor underſtand, we are vindicated and defended from the raſhneſſe and temerity of opinative men. As for them that ſay that we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, but that which we know, they have onely regard to the name of opinion, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe is but baſe and ignominious: but if any one will conſider atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that there is a very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe two things, whither a man thinks that he knows a thing, or whither being moved by ſome authority, he believes that which he underſtands that he knows not, he ſhall certainly ſhun and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the crime both of errour, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and pride.</p>

                        <p>And upon theſe words: (There is a great difference whither any thing be comprehended by certain reaſon of mind, which we ſay, is

But when we ſpeak with words more fit to be commonly uſed, as the Scripture alſo ſpeaketh, we make no doubt to ſay, that we know both that which we perceive by our corporall ſenſes, and which we believe upon the report of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible witneſſes, but yet ſo that we underſtand what difference there is between the one and the other.</p>

                     <p>IF that which is not known ought not to be believed, I ask then how can children obey parents and embrace them with mutuall love and affection, whom they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not to be their parents; for that who is their father, it cannot be known by reaſon, but it is believed upon the word and authority of the Mother: and as for the Mother, ſhe often is not believed, but Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, Nurſes and Servants: For if her child may be ſtoln from her and another put in the place, cannot ſhe deceive being deceived? and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we believe, and that without any doubt and ſtaggering at all, that which we confeſſe we cannot know: and unleſſe this were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60687:269"/>ſo, who ſees not but that Piety the moſt holy tye and bond of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would be violated and defiled by a moſt proud wickedneſſe and offence? For who, though he be a mad man, can think him worthy of blame, who doth perform his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged duties unto thoſe whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be his parents, although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were not? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who will not think fit to have him caſt out of the ſociety of men, who will not love thoſe which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are his true parents, for fear leſt he ſhould love thoſe that are falſe ones? Many arguments may be brought to ſhew that nothing at all remains ſafe and ſecure in humane ſociety, if once we are reſolved to believe nothing which we cannot know nor underſtand. But now hear that whereby I am confident I ſhall at the preſent more eaſily draw and perſwade thee, that ſeeing the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60687:269"/>is concerning Religion, that is about the worſhip of God, and the knowledge of Divine things) thoſe are leſſe to be followed, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, who moſt readily promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing reaſon, do forbid and prohibite us to believe. No man doubts, but that all men are either fools or wiſe men; I call not thoſe wiſemen here, that are prudent, ingenious, and witty, but thoſe that are endued with as firm and certain a knowledge both of Divine and Humane things as man is capable to receive, and do lead their lives and frame their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conformable thereunto: but as for others, how learned or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoever they be, or whither they deſerve to be praiſed or diſpraiſed for the manner of their lives, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and account them in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fools: which being ſo, what man, though but of a ſlender under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth not plainly ſee, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60687:270"/>it is more wholeſome and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for fools to obey the precepts and commands of wiſe men, then to frame and order their lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own judgements and fancies? For every thing that is done, if it be not rightly done, it is a fault: nor can any thing be by any means rightly done, which doth not flow and proceed from right reaſon; now right reaſon is virtue it ſelf; But amongſt what ſorts of men is virtue to be found, but in the mind of a wiſe man? wherefore the wiſeman onely offends not; but every fool offends, unleſſe it be in thoſe actions wherein he doth obey a wiſe man; for ſuch actions do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from right reaſon, nor is the fool to be accounred Maſter (as I may ſay) of his own actions, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were but the inſtrument or ſervant of the wiſe man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be better for all men not to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60687:270"/>offend then to offend: verily all fools would live better if they could be ſervants to wiſe men. And if this without doubt be fit and expedient in things of leſſe moment, as in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or tilling a field, in marrying a wife, in the education and breeding of children, and finally in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging of private affairs: much more is it expedient in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For Humane things are both more eaſie to be known then Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: and in all things that are more holy and more excellent, we ſinne ſo much the more grievouſly and dangerouſly, by how much we owe unto them a greater honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and reſpect. Wherefore thou ſeeſt that from hence forth there remains nothing more for us to do, ſo long as we are fools, but, if we deſire to lead a good and a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, to ſeek out wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men, that by obeying of them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60687:271"/>we may not ſo much feel the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of folly, whilſt it is in us, and at the length we may become wiſe men our ſelves.</p>

                     <p>HEre again ariſeth a queſtion of great difficulty: for how
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60687:271"/>ſhall we that are fools be able to find out a wiſe man, ſeeing that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do indifferently challenge that name unto themſelves, although al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none dare preſume to do it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, when as they do ſo diſagree amongſt themſelves about thoſe things, in the knowledge whereof wiſdome doth conſiſt, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to think that either none of them are wiſe men, or that there is but one certain wiſeman. But when a fool enquires who that is, truly I fee not by what means he can be plainly diſcerned and perceived: for a man cannot know any thing by any ſigns whatſoever, unleſſe he knows the thing it ſelf, whereof theſe be the ſigns; but a fool knows not wiſdome. For wiſdome is not like gold and ſilver and ſuch like things, which thou mayeſt both know when thou ſeeſt, and yet not enjoy and poſſeſſe them: he that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60687:272"/>wants wiſdome cannot ſee nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it with the eye of his mind: for all the things which we perceive with our corporall ſenſes, are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly propoſed and preſented unto us; and therefore we may behold ſtrange and externall things with our eyes, albeit we have not any of the things, nor any thing of that kind: but that which is perceived by the underſtanding, is inwardly in the mind, and it is nothing elſe to have it, but to ſee and behold it. But a fool wants wiſdome, and therefore knowes it not, for he cannot ſee it with his eyes; for he cannot ſee it and not have it: and he cannot have it and ſtill continue and remain a fool: wherefore he knows it not, and whilſt he knows it not, he cannot know it in another place: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man ſo long as he remains a fool, can by moſt certain knowledge find out a wiſe man, by obeying of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60687:272"/>whoſe precepts and commands he may be freed from ſo great an evil as folly is. Now it is God onely that can give ſatisfaction to this mighty difficulty, and afford remedy for this great evil; and becauſe our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is about Religion, unleſſe we both believe that there is a God, and that he gives aſſiſtance to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane minds, we ought not indeed to inquire and ſeek for true Religion. For what do we deſire to find out at length by ſo great an endeavour? What wiſh we to attain unto? Whither do we long to arrive? Is it unto that thing which we believe not to have a being, nor to belong and appertain unto us? Nothing is more perverſe then ſuch a mind. When thou durſt not beg a favour of me, or with impudence durſt crave one doſt thou come to demand how Religion may be found out, when thou thinkeſt not that there is a God.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60687:273"/>and that we care not whither there be any or no? What if it be ſo great a matter, that unleſſe it be diligently ſought for, and with all might and power it cannot be found out? What if the extream difficulty of finding out the meaning and underſtanding of that which ſhall be found out doth vex and trouble the mind of the ſeeker? For what is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and familiar to our eyes, then this light is? and yet after long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and darkneſſe they cannot endure it. What is more fit and commodious for a body that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and exhauſted with ſickneſſe, then meat and drink? Yet we ſee that thoſe that are upon recovery are reſtramed and kept back that they may not preſume to feed ſo plentifully as well men do, leſt by a full diet they ſhould return to their former diſeaſe. I ſpeak of thoſe that are recovering their health: but
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60687:273"/>what do we not enforce the ſick men themſelves to eat ſomething? which is ſo great a trouble unto them, that certainly they would not obey us, did they not believe that they ſhall eſcape that ſickneſſe thereby. When therefore wilt thou ſettle thy ſelf to a moſt painfull and laborious ſearch? When wilt thou adventure to take ſo great care and labour upon thee, as this buſineſſe doth deſerve, when as thou doſt not believe that there is any ſuch thing as that which thou ſeekeſt? Wherefore it was rightly inſtituted and ordained by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Catholick diſcipline, that before all things they ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and perſwaded to believe, that come to receive and embrace Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                     <p>SEeing my diſcourſe is concerning thoſe that deſire to be called Chriſtians. I pray tell me what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can that heretick alledge unto me? What can he ſay to draw me from Believing, as from a raſh and inconſiderate thing? If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to believe nothing, then do I not believe that there is any true Religion in the world: and becauſe I do not believe that there is any ſuch thing, I do not ſeek after it. But he (as I conceive) will ſhew it to the ſeeker; For ſo it is written: He that ſeeks ſhall find. Wherefore I would not come to him that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids me to believe, unleſſe I believed ſomething. Is there any greater madneſſe, then that I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60687:274"/>them onely with a belief which is ſupported by no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and yet that belief alone hath brought me to the ſelf ſame man? What ſhall I ſay, but that all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks do exhort us to believe Chriſt? Can they be more oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to themſelves? Wherein they are to be preſſed two manner of wayes. Firſt they are to be asked, where is the reaſon which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, where the reprehenſion and blaming of raſhneſſe, where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſcience and knowledge? for if it be an abſurd thing to believe anyone without reaſon, why doſt thou expect, why doſt thou go about to have me believe any one without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I may more eaſily be led by thy reaſon? Will thy reaſon build any thing that is firm &amp; ſtable upon the foundation of temerity &amp; raſhneſſe? I ſpeak according to them whom we diſcontent &amp; diſpleaſe by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60687:275"/>For to believe before reaſon, when thou art not yet fit to conceive and underſtand it, and by faith it ſelf to prepare the mind to receive the ſeeds of verity and truth, I judge it to be not onely a moſt wholſome and profitable thing, but alſo ſo neceſſary, that thoſe that have ſick and feeble minds cannot recover their healths without it: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conceive to be a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing and full of raſhneſſe, it is impudently done of them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and exhort us to believe Chriſt. Moreover, I confeſſe that I have already believed Chriſt, and have perſwaded my ſelf, that that is true which he hath ſaid, although this my belief be ſupported by no reaſon. This is the firſt leſſon O heretick which thou wilt teach me; but becauſe I have not ſeen Chriſt himſelf, how he vouchſafed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amongſt men, who is publickly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60687:275"/>reported to have been ſeen even by the eyes of common people, give me leave a little to conſider with my ſelf upon whoſe words I have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that there was a Chriſt, that being already guarded and fortified by ſuch a faith, I may give ear and hearken unto thee; I perceive that I believed and gave credit unto none, but to a ſetled and confirmed opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to a moſt renowned fame and report of people and nations: theſe people alſo I ſee in all places to be in poſſeſſion of the ſecrets and myſteries of the Catholick Church. Why ſhall not I then chiefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them diligently what Chriſt hath commanded, by whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity being moved, I have already believed that Chriſt hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome profitable thing? Wilt thou better expound unto me what Chriſt hath ſaid? whom I would not think to have been, or now to be,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60687:276"/>if thou didſt recommend it unto me to be believed. This therefore (as I ſaid) have I believed upon a famous report of men, confirmed with conſent and antiquity: but you who are both ſo few, and ſo turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ſo new, it is certain you can produce and bring forth nothing which may deſerve credit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. And therefore what a madneſſe is this in thee (to ſay) Believe them (the known multitude of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) that we ought to believe Chriſt, but learn of us (Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) what Chriſt hath ſaid: Why ſo I beſeech thee? Verily, if that known multitude ſhould fail, and could teach me nothing: I ſhould much more eaſily perſwade my ſelf, that I ought not to believe Chriſt at all, then that I ought to believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing concerning him of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but of thoſe by whoſe means I firſt believed him. O mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60687:276"/>or rather folly! I will (ſayſt thou) teach thee what Chriſt hath commanded, in whom thou art already perſwaded to believe. What if I did not believe in him at all, couldeſt thou teach me any thing concerning him? But (ſayſt thou) it behooves thee to believe. What, upon your warrant and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? No (ſayſt thou) for we do by reaſon lead thoſe which do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready believe in Chriſt. Why then ſhall I believe in him? Becauſe it is a grounded report, was it groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon you, or upon others? Upon others ſayſt thou. Shall I believe them firſt, and be afterwards taught and inſtructed by thee? Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ought to do ſo, were I not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things admoniſhed by them not to come at all unto thee: for they ſay that you hold pernicious doctrines. Thou wilt anſwer, they lie. How then may I believe them,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60687:277"/>concerning Chriſt whom they have not ſeen: if I may not believe them concerning thee whom they will not ſee? Here ſayeſt thou, Believe the Scriptures. But all Scripture, if being new and unheard of, it be alledged or commended but by a few, and hath no reaſon to confirm it, receives no credit nor authority at all, but thoſe that alledge it: wherefore if you that are ſo few and unknown commend thoſe Scriptures unto me, I refuſe to believe them: beſides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo you proceed againſt your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, rather by commanding belief, then giving any reaſon thereof. Here again (for the authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) thou wilt call me back to the known multitude of Chriſtendome, and to common report. Reſtrain at length thy obſtinacy, and I know not what unruly appetite of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fame: and rather admoniſh me to ſeek out the chief rulers of this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60687:277"/>known multitude, and to enquire for them diligently and painfully, that rather I may learn ſomething of them touching theſe Scriptures: who if they were not I ſhould not know whither any thing ought to be learnt at all or no. As for thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into thy corner and lurking-hole, and delude us no more under a ſhew and pretence of truth, which thou endeavoureſt to take away from them, unto whom thou grantefl au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and credit: and if they alſo deny, that we ought not to believe Chriſt, unleſſe an undoubted reaſon can be rendred thereof, they are not Chriſtians. For certain Pagans do alledge that againſt us, fooliſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but yet not contrary nor repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to themſelves. But who can endure that thoſe men ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they belong to Chriſt, who ſtrongly affirm that nothing ought to be believed, unleſſe moſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60687:278"/>evident reaſon can be given even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fools, concerning God and divine matters? But we ſee that Chriſt himſelf (as that hiſtory teacheth which they alſo believe) deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more principally, nor more carneſtly, then that he might be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited and believed: when as they with whom he was to treat about thoſe affairs were not yet fit to learn and conceive the divine myſteries. For to what other purpoſe did he work ſo great and ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he himſelf alſo affirming that they were done for no other end, but that men might give credit and beliefe unto him? He led the ſimple ſort of people by belief: you lead them by reaſon: he cryed out that he might be believed, you cry out againſt it: he commended thoſe that did believe, you blame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. But unleſſe he had turned water into wine, to omit his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60687:278"/>other miracles, could men have been brought to follow him, if he had done no ſuch things, but onely taught and inſtructed them? Or is that word of his not to be regarded: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. Believe God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me: Or is he to be blamed for raſhneſſe in belief, who would not have Chriſt come into his houſe, becauſe he believed that by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand onely his ſick ſonne could be cured? <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.8. <hi>He therefore bringing a medicine which was to cure the moſt corrupt manners, did by miracles winne authority, by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority deſerved belief, by belief drew together a multitude by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude obtained antiquity by antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrengthened and confirmed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which not onely the moſt fooliſh novelty of hereticks endeavouring by deceits, but neither the antient er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Gentlies being violently bent againſt it, could in any part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh or deſtroy.</hi>

Which may more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be brought to paſſe, if thou wilt willingly obey his commands which he hath been pleaſed to have confirmed and ſtrengthened by ſo great an authority of the Catholick
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60687:279"/>Church. For ſeeing that a wiſe man is by his mind ſo united unto God that nothing is interpoſed and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which may divide and ſeparate them, (for God is truth, and no man is to be accounted a wiſe man that doth not attain to the knowledge of truth) we cannot deny but that the wiſdome of man is interpoſed as a certain medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his folly and the moſt ſincere truth of the Divine Majeſty. For a wiſe man according to the ability which he hath received, doth imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God: and a fool hath nothing nearer unto him which he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably imitate and follow, then a wiſe man: when becauſe (as I ſaid) it is not eaſie to underſtand by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it was neceſſary that certain mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſhould be propoſed and ſet before mens eyes (which fools do uſe much more commodiouſly then their underſtandings) to the end that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60687:280"/>the life and manners of men moved with authority, might firſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and made clean, and ſo they might be enabled to underſtand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And therefore when as man was to be imitated, and yet no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to be placed in him: how could the Divine Majeſty ſhew greater ſigns of his favour and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, then that the ſincere, eternall, and unchangeable wiſdome of God, unto whom it behoves us to cleave and adhere ſhould vouchſafe to take humane nature upon him? who did not onely do thoſe things, which might ſerve to invite us to follow God: but did alſo endure and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe things, whereby we were diſcouraged from following of him. For whereas no man can obtain the moſt certain and chiefeſt good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he doth fully and perfectly love it, (which by no means will be brought to paſſe ſo long as men fear
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60687:280"/>the miſeries of the body, and the things that are ſubject to fortune and chance) he by his wonderfull birth and admirable works hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us love and charity: and hath excluded terrour and fear by his death and reſurrection. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath ſhewed himſelf to be ſuch an one in all other things (too long to be here expreſſed and ſet down) that we may know and perceive hereby how farre the divine clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can reach and be extended, and how farre mans infirmity can be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and extolled.</p>

For if the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth not rule and govern hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, we ought not to buſie and trouble our ſelves about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but if even the frame and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of all things, which we muſt believe proceeds and flows from ſome fountain of the trueſt beauty, doth as it were publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately exhort all the more noble and braver ſpirits both to ſeek God, in I know not what inward conſcience and to ſerve him: we ought not to deſpair, but that the ſame God hath conſtituted and ordained ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, upon which if we lean and rely as upon a ſure ſtep, we may be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60687:281"/>elevated and lifted up unto him. This authority, (reaſon being ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which to underſtand to be true and ſincere, it is a very hard matter for fools to do, as I have often ſaid) doth move and excite us two manner of wayes: partly by miracles, and partly by the great number and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of followers. It is certain that a wiſe man needs none of theſe things, but now we are diſcourſing how we may become wiſe men, that is, how we may cleave and adhere unto the truth: which is a thing that doubtleſſe cannot be done with a foul and impure mind: the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof, is (to expound it briefly) the love of all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beſides it ſelf and God: from which filth by how much any one is more purged and cleanſed, by ſo much the more eaſily doth he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the truth. And therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee the truth that thou mayſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60687:282"/>cleanſe the mind, when therefore it ought to be cleanſed, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſee the truth, is certainly a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and a prepoſterous thing. Wherefore to a man that is not able to behold the truth that he may be made fit to ſee it, and may ſuffer himſelf to be purged and cleanſed, authority is at hand, which without doubt receives her ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour partly by miracles, and partly by the number and multitude of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as I ſaid a little before. A miracle I call any hard or unwonted thing whatſoever, which appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the expectation and power of the wonderer. In which kind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more fit for the common people, and for men that are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſottiſh and fooliſh, then that which is applyed and propoſed to the ſenſes. But theſe again are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ſorts: for ſome there be that onely move men to wonder
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60687:282"/>and admiration: and others which beſides do winne and purchaſe great favour and good will. For if any one ſhould ſee a man fly, he would onely wonder at it, becauſe it is a thing which beſides the beholding of it, yields to the ſpectatour no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity nor profit. But if any one being afflicted with a grievous and deſperate ſickneſſe, ſhall ſo ſoon as the diſeaſe is commanded to depart, recover his health, he ſhall overcome the wonder of the cure by the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the curer. Such things were done as many as were ſufficient, when God appeared to men in the ſhape of a true man: The ſick were cured, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.6, 13, 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.7, 22. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5, 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.53. the leaprous were cleanſed; <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Mar.</hi> 4, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.3. &amp; 7.22. go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was reſtored to the lame, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.5. ſight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.42. <hi>Joh,</hi> 9.7.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60687:283"/>The men of that time ſaw water turned into wine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.9. five thouſand people filled with five loaves of bread, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.20, 21. men walking upon the ſea, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.19. &amp; 21.7. and the dead riſing from death to life, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.15. &amp; 8.55. So ſome miracles were done for the cure of the body by a more manifeſt benefit, and ſome for the cure of the ſoul by a more hidden ſign, but they were all for the help of mankind by the teſtimony of the Divine Majeſty: thus did the Divine Majeſty then draw unto it the ſtraying ſouls of mortall men. Why (ſayſt thou) are not theſe things done now? Becauſe they would not move unleſſe they were wonderfull, and if they were common and uſuall they were not wonderfull. For bring unto me a man when he firſt ſees the courſes of day and night, and the moſt conſtant order of celeſtiall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60687:283"/>things, the 4. changes of the yeare, the falling and returning of the leeves unto the trees, the infinite vertue of ſeeds, the beauty of light, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of colours, ſounds, ſmels and taſts, and if wee can but ſpeak with him, we ſhall find him wholly aſtoniſhed, and quite overcome with the ſight of theſe miracles: and yet we deſpiſe and we make and account of al theſe things, not becauſe they are eaſily known (for what is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure then the cauſes of them?) but for that we are accuſtomed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee them, thoſe things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt fitly done, that a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of beleevers being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and propagated by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable authority might be converted into cuſtomes themſelves.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60687:284"/>predominancy over us: doeſt not thou think that great care hath been taken about the affaires of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and that they are put into a good ſtate and condition, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divers moſt learned men doe argue and contend, that nothing that is earthly, nothing that is fierie finally, nothing that is perceptible by the corporall ſenſes ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and adored for God, but that he is to be prayed unto, entreated and ſupplicated only by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or intellectuall power: but alſo that the unskilfull multitude of both ſexes doth in ſo many and ſo divers nations both beleeve it and publiſh it? <hi>that there is continency and forbearance of meates, even to the moſt ſlender diet of bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fastings, not for one day on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo continued for divers dayes together; that there is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity even to the contempt of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

                     <p>VVHerefore if either reaſon or our diſcourſe hath any wayes moved thee: and if thou haſt a true care of thy ſelf (as I beleeve thou haſt) I would have thee to hearken and give eare unto me, and with a pious faith, a cheerefull hope, and ſincere charity to addreſſe thy ſelf to good Maſters of Catholick Chriſtianity: and to pray unto God without ceaſing and intermiſſion: by whoſe only goodneſſe we were made and created, by whoſe juſtice we are puniſhed and chaſtized, and by whoſe clemency we are freed and redeemd, by which means thou ſhalt neither want the inſtructions and diſputations of moſt learned men, and thoſe that are truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60687:287"/>nor books, nor cleare and quiet thoughts, whereby thou mayſt eaſily find that which thou ſeekeſt. And as for thoſe verball and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched men (for how can I ſpeake more mildly of them) forſake them altogether: who found out nothing but miſchiefe and evill, whilſt they ſeek to much for the ground thereof. In which queſtion they ſtirre up of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes their hearers to enquire and ſearch, but they teach them thoſe things when they are ſtirred up, that it were better for them alwayes to ſleep, then to watch and take great pains after that manner, for they drive them out of a lethargy or drowſy evill and make them fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike: between which diſcaſes, whereas both are moſt commonly mortall: yet nevertheleſſe there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that thoſe that are ſicke of a lethargy doe die without troubling or moleſting others: but the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60687:287"/>man is dreadfull and terrible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, and unto thoſe eſpecially that ſeek to aſſiſt him. For neither is God the author of evill, nor hath it ever repented him to have made any thing, nor is he troubled with a ſtorme of any commotion or ſtirring of the minde, nor is a particle or piece of earth his kingdome: he neither approves nor commands any heinous crimes or offences, he never lies. For theſe and ſuch like things did move and trouble us, when they did ſtrongly oppoſe them and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt them, and fained this to be the doctrine of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is a moſt abſolute fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood and untruth. Wherefore I graunt that they doe rightly blame and reprehend thoſe things. What then have I learned? what thinkeſt thou, but that when they reprove thoſe things, the Catholike doctrine is not reprehended? ſo that the truth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60687:288"/>which I learned amongſt them, I hold and reteyne: and that which I conceived to be falſe and untrue, I refuſe and reject but the Catholick Church hath alſo taught me many other things, whereunto thoſe men being pale and without bloud in their bodies, both groſſe and heavy in their underſtandings cannot aſpire, namely that God hath no body, that no part of him can be perceived by corporall eyes, that nothing of his ſubſtance and his nature is any wayes vioable or changeable, or compounded or framed, which things if thou graunteſt me to be true (as wee ought not to frame any other conceit of the divine Majeſty) all their ſubtle deviſes and ſhifts are ſubverted and overthrnown. But how it can be, that God hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſed nor done any evill, and that there neither is, nor ever hath been any nature and ſubſtance, which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60687:288"/>he hath not either produced or made, and yet that he frees and delivers us from evill, is a thing approved upon ſo neceſſarie reaſons and grounds, that no doubt at all can be made thereof: eſpecially by thee and ſuch as thou art, if ſo be that to their good wits they joyne piety, and a certaine peace and tranquillity of a minde, without which nothing at all of ſo great matters can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and underſtood, and here is no report of great and large promiſes made to no purpoſe, and of I know not what Perſian fable, a tale more fit to be told to Children then to ingenious and witty men, and as for truth it is a farre other thing then the Manichees do fooliſhly imagine and conceive, but becauſe I have made a farre longer diſcourſe then I thought to have done, let me here end this booke: wherein I would have thee to remember that I have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60687:289"/>not yet begun to refute the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, and impugne thoſe toyes: nor to have expounded any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Catholick doctrine, but that my only intent was to have rooted out of thee if <hi>I</hi> could, the falſe opinion of true Chriſtians which hath been malitiouſly or unskilfully inſinuated unto us, and to ſtirre thee up to the learning of certaine great and divine things. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> will put a period to this worke: and if it makes thy mind more quiet and contented I ſhall peradventure be more ready to ſerve thee in other things.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60687:296"/>
                        <hi>concerning the buriall of men,</hi> which I will here ſet down in the words I then uſed.<q> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed was it poſſible, they ſhould all be buried in ſuch a ruine of Carcaſes. Nor will a pious man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth that ſaying of our Saviour much fear this, nor think that beaſts, which by chance devour their bodies, can at all prejudice their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, being aſſured, that <hi>not an hair of their head ſhall periſh.</hi> For he who is Truth it ſelf would never have ſaid, <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but cannot kill the ſoul,</hi> if it could be any prejudice to the future life of the Saints, that which their enemies do to their bodies here. Unleſſe peradventure a man will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60687:296"/>be ſo abſurd, as to contend, that we ought not before our death to fear them which kill the body, <hi>viz.</hi> leaſt they ſhould kill it, but yet that we ought to fear, leaſt after death they ſhould not ſuffer that body to be buried, which they have already killed. For then certainly it were not true which Chriſt ſayes, <hi>They which kill the body, have no more to do,</hi> if ſo be they could do any thing more towards the dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, that were to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But God forbid, that any thing ſhould be falſe which the Truth hath ſpoken. For we ſay, they which kill, do ſomething while they kill the body, becauſe in the body there is ſenſe and ſome feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while it is to be killed:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60687:297"/>but that afterwards <hi>they have no more to do,</hi> becauſe in a body already killed there is no ſenſe at all. Wherefore many bodies of good Chriſtians have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to want buriall, but none of them could be ever excluded from heaven and earth both, which he totally filleth with his preſence, who beſt knoweth, how and whence to reſtore again that which he once made. It is ſaid indeed in the Pſalmes, <hi>They expoſed the Bodies of thy ſervants for meat to the fouls of the air,</hi>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60687:297"/>aggravate the cruelty of thoſe who did ſuch things, then to intimate any unhappineſſe in them which ſuffered: For although ſuch things at theſe may ſeem hard, yea horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the eyes of men, yet <hi>precious</hi> doubtleſſe <hi>in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi>

Whence it is alſo, that the Funeralls of juſt men in old time, were performed with a great deal of piety &amp; care; their Exequies ſolemnly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, and the places of their buriall with much diligence provided, yea themſelves in their life time,<note place="margin">Gen. 23.47.49.50</note> would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently give command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the burying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60687:300"/>of their bodies after their death, as there was cauſe.<note place="margin">Tob. 2.12</note> And Tobias is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by no leſſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony then of an Angel, to have merited with God, for that he was diligent to bury the dead. Yea our Lord himſelf, (although he were to riſe again within three dayes after his Paſſion) yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the care the good woman had of his buriall, and commanded that the good work ſhe had done in providing ſuch precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to imbalm his body; ſhould be preached, to her praiſe all the world over: &amp; there is honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in the Goſpel of thoſe who took down the body of our Lord from the Croſſe, and gave it Buriall.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60687:300"/>All which Authorities yet are not to teach us, that there is any ſenſe in dead bodies, but onely, ſeeing that ſuch offices of piety are pleaſing to God, they ſignifie unto us, that even the dead bodies do pertain unto the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and this the rather to confirm our Faith in the Reſurrection. And hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we may learn not unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, how great reward there may be for ſuch Alms as we give unto living peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when even that which is beſtowed upon the dead and liveleſſe members is not loſt with God. There are indeed ſome other particulars, which the Holy Patriarchs who ſpeak them, would have to be underſtood concerning the buriall and tranſlating of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60687:301"/>their bodies after death, as ſpoken by a propheticall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but this is no place to treat of them, ſeeing that which we have deliver'd already may ſuffice. For if thoſe things which are neceſſary to the ſuſtenance of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cannot be wanted but with great difficulty, as victualls, apparell <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet do never (when they are wanted) violate or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the virtue of patience in good people, nor extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate piety quite out of the mind, but rather exerciſe and revive it; much leſſe doubtleſs can thoſe things, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expended in Funeralls &amp; Exequies upon deceaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (when they happen to be wanting) make thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons miſerable, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60687:301"/>ſetled and at reſt in thoſe ſecret Tabernacles of the juſt. And therefore when it ſo fell out in the devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that great City and of the adjacent Towns, that the bodies of good chriſtians had not Buriall, we may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently charge either the living with any crime thereabout, who could not help it, nor yet the dead with any great misfortune, who were as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſenſible of it.</q> This is my opinion concerning the matter of Sepulture in generall, which I have therefore tranſlated into this book out of that other of the City of God, in regard it was ſomething more eaſie for me to repeat it in this, then to deliver it in a new manner.</p>

                     <p>NOw if this be ſo, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo the proviſion of place for the burial of bodies at the monuments of Saints muſt have ſomething in it; it muſt be at leaſt an argument of ſome good humane affection toward our friends, whoſe funeralls we celebrate: and if it be ſome kind of Religion to bury them at all, certainly to have care in what place we bury them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be of like merit. But yet, when ſuch comforts as theſe are procured by the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (by which indeed their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection toward their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend is ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to ſurvive) yet I ſay, I perceive not, for my part, any advantage coming thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60687:302"/>the dead, unleſſe it be in this onely reſpect, namely, that when men remember where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their deceaſed friends are placed, they may in their prayers recommend them unto God more effectually by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of thoſe Saints unto whoſe patronage they may ſeem by the place of their Buriall,<note place="margin">Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Saints profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</note> to be received; which yet alſo they might, if they pleaſed, very wel do, ſuppoſing they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in ſuch places. Neither are thoſe more eminent Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of the dead called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi> or <hi>Monuments</hi> for any other reaſon, then becauſe they do as it were, renew or preſerve the remembrance of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as are by death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of men, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they periſh not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60687:303"/>as much in the minds of their friends, as they ſeem loſt to their eye.

So when the Mother afterwards remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the ſame ſepulchre, and in her prayers more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly recommends her Sonne, it is not the place of the dead body, but the Mothers lively affection, (perhaps excited and quickened by the memory of the place) which <hi>ſuccours the ſoul of the deceaſed.</hi> For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it doth not unprofitably concern the religious mind of one that prayeth to conſider at once, both who is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and to whom he is recommended. Even as we ſee men that pray, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo diſpoſe the members
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60687:305"/>of their body, as uſually is moſt proper and effectuall for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants to do, as when they bend their knees, when they ſpread their hands, when they proſtrate their bodies on the ground, or do any other viſible action of that nature; although, I ſay, their inviſible will and hearts intention be known well enough unto God, who needs none of theſe ſigns to make him ſee what is in the heart of man yet certainly the man who prayeth, doth move himſelf to pray, to lament, to grieve by ſuch motions and poſtures as thoſe, much more humbly, much more fervently and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly then otherwiſe he would. Yea, and how it comes to paſs I know not, ſeeing theſe motions of the body are not made but by ſome precedent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60687:305"/>motion of the mind, yet certain it is, that by theſe externall actions viſibly done, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inviſible motion which cauſed them, is reciprocally increaſed, and by this means that affection of mind which preceded thoſe Actions as the cauſe of them, is it ſelf alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, becauſe they are done: and yet notwithſtanding, when it happens that a man is held in ſuch ſort, or perhaps tyed by conſtraint, that he cannot ſo diſpoſe his corporall members as willingly he would, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour man ceaſeth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to pray, nor yet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelf before Almighty God in the more ſecret Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of a contrite heart.</p>
                     <p>In like manner truly it much imports, where a man can place the dead body of him, for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60687:306"/>whoſe ſoul he intends to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate almighty God;<note place="margin">Obſerve this, that it much imports even wherthe body is interred.</note> becauſe both his precedent affection did chuſe an holy place, and alſo having put the body there, the remembrance of the ſame place revives and increaſes that affection which preceded it. But nevertheleſſe a religious friend being determined to give buriall to him whom he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, although he cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps obtain to bury him where he would, yet let him not by any means forbear neceſſary prayers in his recommendation: for whatſoever becometh of the dead body,<note place="margin">Reſt of the ſouls to bee procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even after death.</note>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60687:306"/>euil. Nor doth the ſpirit of man after departure expect, that its life ſhould be any way relieved now by that fleſh, to which it ſelf, when time was, afforded life; which life at the hour of death it carried away with it ſelf, and ſhall reſtore again, when it returnes. For this is certain, the fleſh procures not the merit of Reſurrection to the ſpirit but the ſpirit to the fleſh, whither it revives unto pain or glory.</p>

                     <p>ALL which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon of that naturall and inbred affection which is in men, in reſpect whereof it is ſaid that <hi>no man ever hated his own fleſh,</hi> if they perceive that any thing be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their death to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto their bodies, which the ſolemnity of funerall would require at leaſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and place where they live, we ſee, they cannot forbear to be ſad like men, and ſollicitous for that proviſion touching their bodies before death, of which, when they are once dead, they ſhall not be ſenſible at all. Yea ſo far doth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that in the book of <hi>Kings</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60687:308"/>we read, how God Almighty himſelf by one Prophet threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth another, who had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed his command, that his body ſhould not be buried in the Sepulchre of his Fathers. The words of Scripture are theſe. <hi>Thus ſaith our Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3 Reg. 13.21.</note> 
                        <hi>Foraſmuch as thou haſt diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the mouth of our Lord, and haſt not kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which our Lord thy God commanded thee, but cameſt back, and haſt eaten bread, and drank water, in the place in which our Lord commanded thee not to eat bread, nor drink water, thy carcaſe ſhall not be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſepulchre of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Which puniſhment, if we conſider it according to the Goſpel, where (as hath been often ſaid) we are taught
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60687:309"/>not to fear, after our departure, any thing that may be done to our dead members, it will ſcarce ſeem to be any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all: but if we reflect upon that humane affection, which all men naturally bear to their own fleſh, a man can hardly chooſe but be contriſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, even while he liveth, for that, which when he is dead, he ſhall not feel. In this reſpect therefore it was a puniſhment unto the Prophet, that he could not forbear to grieve at preſent, for that which ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward befall his body, though when it ſhould indeed befall, he were ſure enough to have no ſenſe of it. For the will of our Lord doubtleſſe was to chaſtiſe his ſervant thus far one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who had tranſgreſſed his command, not ſo much by any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60687:309"/>particular pravity of his own will, as through the fallacy of another who deceived him, and made him think he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the command of God, when he did not. And it were very hard to think otherwiſe, as that his body being killed by the tearings of that beaſt, his ſoul ſhould alſo be plucked away at the ſame time to the torments of hell. No, we ſee the Lyon which killed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſtantly his Guardian, and defended his body from the ravening of other beaſts, yea the very Aſſe on which he rode, remained untouched, ſeeming to aſſiſt as it were, with an undaunted preſence, at the Funeralls of his Maſter; which certainly was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miracle, and an evident ſign that the man of God in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60687:310"/>that caſe was corrected onely unto a temporall death, and not at all puniſhed afterward: not much unlike to that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commemorated the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, yea deaths of many of the people, for ſome particular offenſes among them, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes at laſt thus, <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged by our Lord, but when we are judged, we are chaſtized by our Lord, leſt we ſhould be condemned with the world.</hi> And truly he who had deceived this Prophet, buryed him afterward in his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument with ſufficient honour, yea and took order beſide, that himſelf might be afterwards buryed as near as might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his corps, hoping, (as we may probably ſuppoſe) that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60687:310"/>by this means his own bones might be ſpared, when the time ſhould come, according to the propheſie of this very man of God, that the good King <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> ſhould cauſe the bones of many dead people to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interred, and thoſe idolatrous altars which had been built un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtrange Gods, in and about Hieruſalem, to be defiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For ſo indeed it came to paſſe: The Monument wherein this Prophet was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, who foretold thoſe things three hundred years before, and the Sepulchre of him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, were ſpared. And ſo we ſee, out of that naturall affection by which every man loves his own fleſh,<note place="margin">4 Reg. 23.12.</note> this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was carefull to provide for the temporall ſecurity of his body even after death,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60687:311"/>who yet by a lye (ſo much as in him lay) cared not to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his ſoul for ever. In this reſpect therefore, that every one naturally loveth his own fleſh, it was ſome kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the one to know, that he ſhould not come to be buried in the Sepulchre of his fathers; and in the other (if that had been all) a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not unworthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, <hi>viz.</hi> to lay his bones in a Sepulchre, which he was ſure none would vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>

                     <p>THe Martyrs indeed, while they fought for the truth, vanquiſhed this affection; and it was no marvell they ſhould: for they who could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with any torments they ſuffered alive, it had been very ſtrange, ſhould they have ſhrunk at any thing which was to follow after death, whereof they ſhould have no ſenſe. Doubtleſſe God Almighty, who ſuffered not the Lyon ſo much as to touch the Prophet after he was dead, but as it were commanded him to gard that body which he had ſlain, could as eaſily, if he had ſo pleaſed, have kept off thoſe doggs from the bodies of his ſervants, he could have terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60687:312"/>by a hundred wayes the cruell minds of thoſe people, that they ſhould not have da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either to burn their bodies, or to throw about their aſhes. But this was a tryall of thoſe Saints not fit to be wanting to the reſt of their ſufferings, that the fortitude of their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was already well ſeen in not yielding to any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſave their life, might yet be conſummated as it were, and perfected in this, that for Chriſts ſake they regarded as little the honour of Sepulture, remaining through their Faith in the Reſurrection, as ſecure of their bodies, as they were of their ſouls. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo it was fit that ſuch things ſhould be permitted to be done, that the Martyrs themſelves by ſuch glorious
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60687:312"/>combats ſhould become fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent witneſſes of that Truth, which from our Saviour they had learned, namely, That they which thus cruelly tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized over their bodies, after death <hi>had no more to do;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whatſoever they ſhould attempt upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies once dead would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: nothing I ſay, either in reſpect of the ſoul, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath ſenſe, and was already departed; or in reſpect of God the Creatour, whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is ſuch, as nothing can be loſt which he hath made. And yet notwithſtanding, while theſe Martyrs themſelves with infinite courage ſuffered ſuch things, not caring (for the love of Chriſt) what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of their bodies dead or alive; their fellow-brethren, the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60687:313"/>reſt of the Chriſtians had great ſorrow at the ſame time, were much afflicted, that by reaſon hereof and of the extream vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance of their perſecutours, they could not perform the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of their funeralls, no not ſo much as to procure private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the leaſt Relick of them,<note place="margin">Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in old times uſed dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to get any ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of Saints.</note> as the ſame hiſtory ſheweth. So as, when no evil at all touched them who were killed, either that their bodies were torn in pieces, or their bones burnt, or their aſhes caſt abroad, yet in the living we ſee, there was much ſorrow and affliction, becauſe they were not able to do that for their friends, which this naturall affection ſeemed to require: that is, there was in them a great deal of fenſe for that, of which the dead had no ſenſe, and much compaſſion,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60687:313"/>as I may ſo ſay, where indeed was no Paſſion at all.</p>

                     <p>According unto which kind of <hi>miſerable compaſſion,</hi> as it may be called, we reade, thoſe men were highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by King <hi>David,</hi> who had buried, that is,<note place="margin">2 Reg 2.5.</note> ſhewed ſuch pity unto the dry bones of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi> But can any pity be ſhewen to them who have no ſenſe of miſery? Or ſhall we ſay, that this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the opinion of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> that deceaſed people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe that river of Hell, cannot come at the Elyſian fields, nor be at reſt, till their bodies be buried? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that Chriſtianity ſhould admit ſuch a Paradox. If that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60687:314"/>were true, millions of Martyrs were in a miſerable caſe, whoſe bodies were never buried, yea and the Truth it ſelf had much deceived them, ſaying, <hi>Fear not them who kill the body, and afterward have no more to do,</hi> if they could do them ſo great miſchief yet after death, as to hinder their paſſe unto their deſired reſt. But ſeeing this is ſo undoubtedly falſe, and that for certain the want of buryall hurteth faithfull ſouls no more, then it doth advantage an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell to be buried ſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what may the reaſon then be, that the good and religious King <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſo highly commend them, who buried <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſon? Certainly it was nothing but this, <hi>viz.</hi> the good affection, with which their hearts were touched, who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60687:314"/>buried them, and that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be affliction to them, that ſuch calamity ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the bodies of others, as out of that naturall love which all men bear to themſelves, they would never wiſh to their own; and that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yea ſtudious, while they lived, and knew what they did, to exhibite thoſe good offices to others, though unſenſible of them, which they would be glad ſhould be performed to themſelves afterward, when they alſo ſhould be paſt all ſenſe.</p>

                     <p>BUt there are certain viſions recounted, which may ſeem to move no inconſiderable doubt in this point. For they ſay, that fundry deceaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been known to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto the living, not onely in their ſleep, but otherwiſe, and to tell their friends, who were otherwiſe ignorant of it, in what places their bodies lay unburied, ſeeming to deſire, that thoſe duties which were wanting might be performed towards them. Now if we ſhould ſay that theſe things were falſe, we might be thought to uſe more boldneſſe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came us, both in regard of the writings of ſome faithfull Chriſtians who report it, as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60687:315"/>alſo in regard of the teſtimony and ſenſible experience of thoſe to whom ſuch viſions have happened. We ſhall anſwer therefore, that it follows not, that the dead have any ſenſe at all of what is done to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe they ſeem to ſpeak, to declare or deſire ſuch and ſuch things of men in their ſleep. For even the living ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times appear unto the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while they ſleep, when themſelves know not that they do appear, and afterward hear men relate with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the things which they dreamed, affirming that ſuch and ſuch things they ſaw them, that is to ſay, their friends that ſhould appear to them, do or ſpeak in their ſleep. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for inſtance ſake, it be poſſible for a man to ſee me in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60687:316"/>his ſleep, telling him, that ſome ſuch thing is done, or ſhall be done, my ſelf in the mean time not knowing nor perceiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing, yea ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding what he dreams, that I neither know nor care, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a perſon ſleeps when I wake, or waketh when I ſleep, or whither it happens not, that we ſleep or wake both of us at that ſame time, when he ſuppoſeth he ſees me in his ſleep: if I ſay, this be poſſible, what wonder is it if the dead, without any reall ſenſe or knowledge of ſuch things themſelves, ſhould alſo be ſeen of the living, yea and tell them ſomething, which when they wake they may find to be true. I rather think indeed that all this is done by the miniſtery of ſome Angels, whither by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60687:316"/>divine permiſſion onely or command, that they ſignifie ſuch things unto men by way of viſion, touching the burying of thoſe bodies, whoſe ſpirits at that time know not any thing what becomes of their bodies. For this doubtleſſe is not altogether unprofitably done, whither we regard the comfort of the living to whom thoſe dead people belong, whoſe Ghoſts do ſeem thus to appear, or the office of buriall it ſelf, which is matter of ſo commendable charity even to mankind in generall, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the dead receive no particular comfort thereby, yet it cannot be wholly neglected without offence of Religion; ſometimes indeed men are much miſled by fallacious and imaginary viſions, but they are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60687:317"/>moſt commonly ſuch, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve juſtly to be ſo deluded: as for example, when any one ſees in his dreams ſuch things as Aeneas is reported to have met with in his imaginary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels through hell, and that the Ghoſt of ſome unburied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould appear to him, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſame things of him, which Palinurus is fabled to have done of Aeneas, that is to ſay, the interring of his corps, and that when he awakes he ſhould indeed find the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in ſuch a place as was told him in his dream; if becauſe he finds thus much of his dream to be true, he ſhould fall to think, that therefore mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are buried, that the ſouls thereby may paſſe unto thoſe places of reſt, to which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the law of Hell they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60687:317"/>could not paſſe, who doubts but that this man ſhould groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceive himſelf, and deviate from the Truth?</p>

                     <p>YEt ſuch is the generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of men that when at any time they happen to have a viſion in their ſleep of any dead perſon, preſently they imagine the very ſoul of ſuch a man appears to them; when as at the ſame time, if they happen to dream of one, or ſee one that is alive, they never take it either for body or ſoul, but as it is indeed, for a meer ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of ſuch a man appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; as if perchance it were not altogether as poſſible, for the ſimilitudes of ſouls, as wel as of bodies, (in the abſence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60687:318"/>of the ſouls themſelves &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowledge thereof) to be preſented to men in their dreams.</p>
                     <p>This, which I am about to tell, when I was at <hi>Millain,</hi> I heard reported for certain. A certain debt was demanded of one by virtue of a writing under his deceaſed fathers hand, which debt had been diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Father living, his ſonne not knowing thereof, nor yet how to make it appear that it was diſcharged: he was therefore much troubled and perplexed at it, wondring why his Father at his death, and at the making of his Teſtament ſhould not acquaint him with that debt. Being thus in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, his Father in his ſleep appears to him, and tels him where he ſhould find the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60687:318"/>of that debt recorded; which the ſonne accordingly ſeeking found and produced, and thereby not onely voided the Action of debt, which was unjuſtly brought againſt him, but alſo recovered the writing it ſelf, which his Father when he paid the mony, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to take out: In this caſe therefore it cannot but ſeem, that the ſoul of the Father had a care of his ſonne, by coming to him and telling him matter of importance, which himſelf knew not of, and thereby delivering him from a great deal of trouble. But at the ſame time that I heard this, namely while I ſtayed at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> there happened at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> ſomething which makes me doubt: it was this. <hi>Eulogius</hi> the Rhetorician there, one who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60687:319"/>had been formerly my ſcholar in that Art, (as himſelf told me the ſtory afterwards, when I was come again into <hi>Africk</hi>) was reading to his Scholars <hi>Tullies</hi> books of Rhetorick, and peruſing the leſſon or place which he was to expound publickly the next day in the Schools, he met with one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure paſſage in it, which he could not poſſibly underſtand, and was therefore very much perplexed about it, yea could take no reſt all that night, till, as he ſaid, I my ſelf appeared to him and told him the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: yet certainly not I my ſelf, but ſome image or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of me; for I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the buſineſſe, I was far from him on the other ſide of the ſea, buſied about other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, had no thoughts, no care,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60687:319"/>not ſo much as dream't, what my Scholar might be doing. Now how theſe things come to paſſe, I confeſſe I know not, yet which way ſoever they do, why may we not think, that the appearances of the dead and living both, are, as it were, much one and the ſame, effected in one and the ſame manner, and by one and the ſame means, that is, neither the living nor the dead knowing at all, when themſelves or their ſimilitudes do ſo appear.</p>

                     <p>NOt unlike unto dreams are the viſions which ſome have both living and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, namely thoſe who are troubled in their mind, frantick or diſtempered people; for ſuch many times we obſerve talking to themſelves as unto companions, ſometimes with ſuch as are abſent, as if they were preſent, and with the dead as if they were alive, and this by reaſon of the <hi>Idea's</hi> or forms of ſuch perſons or things as by accident get into their fancy. But even as the living themſelves, in ſuch caſes, know not that they ſeem to appear and ſpeak unto ſuch perſons, who through diſtemper of mind do conceive themſelves
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60687:320"/>to fee and hear them; (for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality ſure they are neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, nor talking to them, but onely the poor men have ſuch phantaſms in their head which trouble them,) ſo alſo is it, when they imagine themſelves to talk or converſe with any that be dead; for the dead come not at them, nor do they know whither ſuch people think of them yea or no.</p>
                     <p>And like unto this is alſo an other caſe of ſome people, who ſeem, as it were, to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from themſelves, and more deprived of their bodily ſenſes, then they ſhould be, if they onely ſlept, yet in the mean time entertained with ſtrange viſions. For unto ſuch alſo appear the ſimilitudes of living and dead men: and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60687:321"/>when they come again to their ſenſes, if they report that they ſaw any of the dead, men are apt to believe that in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies they were really with thoſe dead, not conſidering how at the ſame time, upon their report, they alſo ſaw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which were alive, and far enough diſtant from them, and no way thinking of them, as I ſhall ſhew you by one notable example. A certain ordinary perſon of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's</hi> incorporation, which is nigh unto <hi>Hippo,</hi> one <hi>Curina</hi> by name, a poor Officer in that place, and ſcarce got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rank of a <hi>Duumvir,</hi> and an abſolute ruſtick beſide, fell ſick, had his ſenſes quite taken from him, and lay for ſome dayes in a manner dead, yet ſome little breath remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60687:321"/>in him, which could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceived by laying ones finger to his noſthrills, yet it ſerved for ſome ſlender token of life, ſo as he was not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as one abſolutely dead; he ſtirred not one member of his body, received no kind of ſuſtenance all that while, perceived no body, either by ſight or any other ſenſe, what pain ſoever they laboured to put him to; yet in his viſion he ſaw many things, which at length after many dayes awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king he reported. And firſt of all upon the very opening of his eyes, <hi>Let ſome body,</hi> quoth he, <hi>go to Curina the Smiths houſe and ſee what's to do there;</hi> whither when the meſſenger came, that <hi>Curina, viz.</hi> the Smith, was found to be dead, in that very moment when
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60687:322"/>this other returned to his ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſeeming, as it were, to be reſtored from death to life. Then he told thoſe who ſtood about him, that <hi>Curina</hi> the Smith was commanded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the very time, that himſelf was diſcharged, and that when he was diſmiſſed, in the place from whence he came, he heard it ſaid, that not <hi>Curina</hi> the Officer, but <hi>Curina</hi> the Smith was the man commanded to be brought unto thoſe places of the dead. In this extaſie therefore of his, as in a viſion, he may ſeem to have converſed with the dead, yea to have ſeen them <hi>treated,</hi> as doubtleſſe they are, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>to their ſeverall merits.</hi> And truly perhaps I ſhould have thought my ſelf, he had converſed with the very ſouls
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60687:322"/>of the dead, if he had not alſo ſeen in that viſion ſundry which are yet alive, namely, ſome Churchmen of his own Countrey, by the Prieſt whereof he was told, that at <hi>Hippo</hi> he ſhould be baptized by me, which accordingly, he ſaid, was done. Wherefore in that viſion, it is clear, he ſaw both a Prieſt, certain of the Clergy, my ſelf; none of us all as yet dead, as well as he ſaw thoſe that were dead. Why then might he not ſee us all both dead and living, after one manner, that is, not preſent but abſent, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ignorant of what he ſaw, in a word, not in our perſons, but in our ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, even as he did the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo? For he ſaw the Field where the Prieſt was, he ſaw
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60687:323"/>not only the Clarks, but the whole City of <hi>Hippo</hi> it ſelf, where he was Baptized; in which places yet certainly he was not, for he knew nothing of what was done at <hi>Hippo</hi> all that time, which he would have done doubtleſſe, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he had been there. All this therefore was but by the way of viſion, wherein things paſſe not alwayes in themſelves or in verity of their ſubſtance, but are repreſented in Image or Similitude onely. Laſtly, after many other things which he ſaw, he told how he was taken up into Paradiſe, and that it was ſaid to him, when he was diſmiſſed and ready to return to his friends, Go, Be Baptized, if ever you will live in this place of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and when they told him
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60687:323"/>further, that he muſt be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized by me, he anſwered, it was done already, but hee who communed with him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and be Baptized indeed, for all this thou haſt ſeen but in viſion.</hi> After this, the man recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and came to <hi>Hippo.</hi> Eaſter approching he delivered in his name among the reſt of the <hi>Competents,</hi> unknown to me, and not much caring, as it ſeems, to tell his Viſion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to my ſelf or any about me. But Baptized he was, and when the Holy-dayes were over, he went home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his own, and a year or two it was, before I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood any of theſe particulars, which I firſt learned from a friend of mine and his, ſitting at table together and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60687:324"/>of ſuch matters. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I became my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive concerning the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and cauſed him to make relation of the whole matter to my ſelf in preſence of many honeſt men, his fellow Citizens, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves teſtified the ſtrange ſickneſſe which he had, and that for the ſpace of many dayes he lay as one dead, and what happened to that other <hi>Curina</hi> the Smith; and when he repeated all things, as I have related, his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that ſtood by, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and teſtified that they had heard the ſame things from him before. Wherefore, as he ſaw his own Baptizing, and me, and the City of <hi>Hippo,</hi> the Church and the Font, not in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60687:324"/>things themſelves, or their very ſubſtance, but by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſimilitudes, ſo alſo did he ſee many other perſons alive, which neither knew nor had thought of him.</p>

                     <p>VVHy then might he not ſee thoſe deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons (which he ſaw) not in their own perſons or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but in repreſentation onely, they themſelves neither ſeeing nor converſing with him? Why ſhall we not ſay, that ſuch things as theſe may be the operations of ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by order of the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,<note place="margin">Angels appear to the living.</note> who is pleaſed to uſe both the good and bad (yet both well) according to the unſearchable depth of his Judgments, whither mens minds be thereby inſtructed or deceived, whither they be comforted or troubled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as every one is capable of puniſhment or favour from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60687:325"/>him whoſe <hi>Mercy and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both</hi> his Church worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrateth? But let every man judge of this as he thinks beſt. Certainly, if the ſouls of the dead could be ſo preſent in the affaires of the living, and converſe with us, as they ſeem to do ſometimes in our ſleep; not to ſpeak of others, my own deare Mother would not forbear me one night, who while ſhe lived, followed me both by Sea and Land to enjoy my company: for God forbid, that by being Bleſſed her ſelf, ſhe ſhould be now leſs tender-hearted towards me, that ſhe ſhould not, when any thing afflicts my heart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her ſon as ſhe uſed to do, whom, when time was, ſhe loved with moſt ſingular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and could never endure
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60687:326"/>to ſee him grieved. But ſurely that is moſt true, which the Pſalmiſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 26.10.</note> namely <hi>That my Father and Mother have forſaken me, yet our Lord hath taken me up.</hi> If then (as the Scripture ſaith) our Fathers have forſaken us, how are they preſent with our affayres? how know they our cares? And if our Fathers themſelves are not preſent, do not know our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, what are thoſe other dead, which ſhould know them? Iſaias the Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou art our Father, becauſe Abraham is ignorant of us and Iſrael knows us not.</hi> If ſuch great Patriarch's were ignorant of what was done touching the people of their own poſterity, yea to whom for their faith in God that people and poſterity were eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60687:326"/>promiſed, who can think that the dead generally do mixe themſelves or meddle one way or other in the affaires of the living? in what ſenſe can we ſay, it was happy for them who dyed before ſuch or ſuch evils happened, if even after death they were to be ſenſible of the calamityes of the times? or ſhall we peradventure ſay, that the errour is on our part, who will needs ſuppoſe them to be at reſt, whom yet the reſtleſs or calamitous lifes of others here do indeed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually diſquiet? But if ſo, what then would be the meaning, what ſpeciall favour in that promiſe which God Almighty made unto the good King Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, namely that hee ſhould dy before, that he ſhould not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60687:327"/>live to ſee the evills which were threatned unto that place and people? The words of God are theſe. <hi>Thus ſaith our Lord the God of Iſrael, my words which thou haſt heard, and didſt tremble before my face when thou heardeſt what I ſpeak againſt this place and againſt the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it ſhould be forſaken, and become a Curſe, and haſt rent thy cloaths and wept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; I alſo have heard, ſaith our Lord, it ſhall not be: Behold I will gather thee unto thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be placed in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evils which I will bring upon this place and the Inhabitants thereof.</hi> This good King was terrifyed with the threatnings of God All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60687:327"/>had wept and tore his garments, and is therefore as to his own perſon, ſecured againſt all thoſe calamityes which were to come, by the promiſe of a timely death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came, and that he ſhould ſo reſt in peace, that none of all thoſe evills ſhould touch him. Therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the Spirits of men departed are there, where they neither know nor feel the accidents of this life. How then do they viſit their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres? how can they know whither their bodyes be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed or unburyed? how can we make them partake of the miſeryes of the living? Seeing if they be bad, they have enough to ſuffer of their own: if otherwiſe, they reſt in peace,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60687:328"/>(as the good King Joſias was to doe) having no ſenſe of evill at all, either in the way of paſſion or compaſſion, but as abſolutely free and diſcharged of whatſoever concernes this world.</p>

                     <p>BUt perhaps ſome will ſay, if the dead have no care for the living, why did that rich Glutton in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> being himſelf in hell, pray Father Abraham to ſend La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus unto his five Brethren yet living in the world, and to deale with them, ſo as they might not come to that place of torment? But muſt we needs think that becauſe <hi>Dives</hi> ſayd thus, that therefore he did know at that time what his Brethren did, or how their ſtate was? no verily, but we may think his care of the living (though he knew not particularly what
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60687:329"/>they did) was ſuch, as our care for the dead is, who know not certainly eyther what they do, or where they are and yet we have ſome kinde of care of them; for if we had not, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>we ſhould never pray for them.</hi> Neyther did Abraham ſend Lazarus unto them, but replyed, <hi>they have Moyſes and the Prophets,</hi> whom they ought to follow, to the end they came not into thoſe places of torment. And if you object, how could Abraham himſelf know that they had Moyſes &amp; the Prophets, if the dead know nothing of the affayres of the world after death (for Moyſes and the Prophets were all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Abraham:) &amp; how could he know that by obſerving the precepts of Moyſes and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60687:329"/>Prophets men might eſcape hell, yea how could he know that this Dives had lived all his life long in ryot and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and poore Lazarus in paynes? for ſo he tells him plainly, <hi>Son remember that thou didſt receive good things in thy life, and Lazarus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evill:</hi> if I ſay you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that therefore Abraham, though dead, muſt needs know many things done among the living; I ſhall anſwere he did certainly know them, yet not then when they were a doing, or perhaps but newly done in the world, but afterwards, as he might by ſundry wayes, and particularly the ſtate of Dives and Lazarus he knew, not when Dives and Lazarus lived in the world, but afterwards
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60687:330"/>when they were both dead, hee might learn it of Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus; leaſt otherwiſe that which the Prophet ſaith might ſeem not to hold true, viz. that <hi>Abraham knoweth us not.</hi>

The ſouls of the dead alſo may know ſome things by divine Revelation, either of ſuch things as be neceſſary for them to know, or at leaſt not neceſſary to be unknown, and this not only of things paſt or preſent, but of thoſe alſo which are to come, even as in times paſt not all men in generall were made acquainted with the Secrets of God, but only Prophets and ſuch other holy men while they lived, and they not every one of them knowing all things, but every one ſome, according as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence was pleaſed to reveale. And that ſome of the dead alſo may be ſent unto the living, the Scripture it ſelf doth teſtifie, (as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily S. Paul from among the

                     <p>HEnce alſo we anſwer an other queſtion, <hi>viz,</hi> what may be ſaid of the Martyrs, <hi>who by the favours which are granted unto ſuch as pray unto them</hi> do declare themſelves both to underſtand and to have care of our affairs,<note place="margin">7 favours obteined by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Saints.</note> if the dead know not at all what the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do? for 'tis certain, and we know it by report of witneſſes beyond exception, that when the City of <hi>Nola</hi> was beſiedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Confeſſour <hi>Felix,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Saints appear miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated.</note> not onely by the effects of his particular favours, but even perſonally and in plain view did appear unto many good people inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting that City, whom he had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60687:333"/>formerly dearly loved. But it muſt be ſaid, that ſuch things as thoſe happen miraculouſly, and are farre different from the uſuall courſe, which God hath appointed unto the nature of all ſorts of things. For becauſe our Lord turned once water into wine, we muſt not therfore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what the nature of water is and what its proper virtue in the order of elements is, not becauſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> roſe again from death, that therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that dyeth may riſe again when he will, or that a dead man is raiſed by no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power, then another is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened out of ſleep. For to ſpeak according to the limits and condition of mans nature in it ſelf is one thing, and to ſpeak according as God is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60687:333"/>pleaſed to demonſtrate his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power in it is another: and the things which come to paſſe naturally and as it were by conſtant courſe are of one ſort, and thoſe which are done mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly by God are of an other; yet is God alwayes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant unto nature, without whom it could not be, and in miracles themſelves nature is not abſolutely excluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at leaſt <hi>in her</hi> though not <hi>by her</hi> they are wrought. We muſt not therefore imagine, that the dead do ordinarily and of courſe mix themſelves in the affairs of the living, becauſe the Martyrs do ſomtimes ſhew themſelves preſent,<note place="margin">How mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are wrought by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints.</note> for the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or help of ſome particular perſons: But rather we are to know, it is by divine power of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60687:334"/>priviledge &amp; diſpenſation that the Martyrs themſelves are preſent with us at any time, becauſe the dead generally &amp; by any vertue of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be ſo.

                        <hi>who for certain are helped by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> is a mater farre above my capacity: that is to ſay, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Martyrs be preſent in their own perſons at the ſame time in ſo divers and farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant places as their <hi>Memories</hi> are, or that they otherwiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſhew themſelves: or whither that God Almighty, the Martyrs abiding alwayes in that place which is <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their merits,</hi> farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the converſation of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60687:334"/>men, yet praying generally for the neceſſities of thoſe <hi>who pray unto them,</hi> in the ſame manner as <hi>we pray for the dead</hi> (to whom we are never preſent, nor know where they be, or what they do) or I ſay, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God Almighty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is every where preſent, though not as joyned to us, nor as divided from us, hearing the prayers which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs make, doth by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Angels, which he ſends abroad into all places, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite ſuch comforts unto people againſt the miſeries of this life, as he ſeeth to be moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who by his wonderfull power and goodneſſe giveth <hi>teſtimony unto the merits of his Martyrs</hi> both where,<note place="margin">Merits of the Martyrs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by S.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60687:337"/>with the Holy man, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his manner to admit the converſation of women upon any terms, he refuſed, but yet <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>tell your wife ſhe ſhall ſee me at night, but it ſhall be in her ſleep;</hi> and ſo ſhe did. The good man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to her, and inſtructed her in all the duties of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife, as ſhe her ſelf, as ſoon as ſhe did awake, told her husband, deſcribing the man of God to him, in ſuch form and ſhape as he knew him to have.

Now ſuppoſing theſe things to be done, ſometimes as I have ſaid, by the Martyrs themſelves preſent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60687:339"/>by the preſence of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, by what ſigns they may be diſcerned or diſtinguiſhed the one from the other, none I ſuppoſe, can certainly know or determine, but he onely who hath <hi>the proper gift</hi> thereof, which <hi>gift</hi> is diſtributed unto every one who hath it, by the Spirit of God, according as himſelf pleaſeth. That holy man <hi>John,</hi>

Nay, if perchance he ſhould anſwer

For ſurely, there being many things ſo obſcure and intricate, that we can hardly expect to attain them perfectly in this life, it ſhould be no ſmall advantage, but to know clearly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that they are not to be enquired further after: as when a man ſtudies hard to learn a thing, which he ſuppoſeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will be much for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, yet I think it doth him no harm, when an other man rightly informs him, how to do as well without it.</p>

                     <p>TO conclude therefore, things ſtanding thus as hath been ſaid, we are not to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that any thing we do for the dead doth profit them, ſave that onely which we beg for them of Almighty God, by the ſacrifices which we make to him on their behalf,<note place="margin">Maſſe, Almes, and Prayer profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the dead accord. to S.

But becauſe we our ſelves diſcern not certainly among the dead,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60687:341"/>who are ſuch, and who are not ſuch, it is thought more expedient to do theſe things in generall <hi>for all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full departed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A pious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> to the intent that none be omitted to whom ſuch favours may of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. For it is much better, if it ſo fall out, that ſome thing ſuperfluous be done in regard of thoſe who receive neither good nor harm by them, then that any thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhould be wanting to thoſe who have need. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit every man performeth theſe things with more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and devotion for his particular friends then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; as expecting the ſame meaſure of Charity after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from his own. But as to this matter of Funerall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60687:341"/>and all that ſolemnity which we uſe about interring the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whatſoever is ſpent or done that way it is no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour or ſalvation to the ſoul, but an office of pure humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty agreeable unto and iſſuing from that affection, whereby all men naturally love <hi>their own fleſh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The final reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the queſtion, that it is good carefully to bury the dead and alſo to bury them in places conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to Martyrs, and when their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques are the reaſon of it.</note> yea and think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that in ſome caſes a man ſhould have care of his neighbours body, as well as of his own, and in this caſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, when the ſpirit is gone to whom it did belong, when time was, to uphold and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it. And truely if they who believe not the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fleſh, do yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch things to their dead, how much more ought we to do ſo who believe not onely
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60687:342"/>that the dead body ſhall riſe again and live for ever, but that the performance of ſuch good offices towards them is it ſelf in ſome ſort a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that Faith. But that we bury them at the <hi>Memories</hi> of the Martyrs, as I have ſaid before, in this reſpect onely it ſeems to me to advantage the dead, namely that thereby the affection of his friends <hi>praying for him, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the Patronage of theſe martyrs,</hi> may be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Thus have you my anſwer, framed as well as I could, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch points as you thought expedient to enquire of me: if it ſeems overlong, I deſire you would pardon me, and impute it to the delight and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60687:342"/>affection I have to hold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with you. As for the book it ſelf, I intreat your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Charity would let me know by your letters ere long what you think of it. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it will be much more welcome for the bearer's ſake, <hi>viz.</hi> our Brother and fellow-Prieſt <hi>Candidianus,</hi> whom for the report your letters gave of him, I received with all affection, and diſmiſſed again as much againſt my will: For verily he much comforted us with his preſence in Chriſts Charity; and to ſpeak but the truth, I compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your deſires much upon his inſtance. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed your letters found me ſo diſtracted with other cares, that you may attribute not a
